Everything else should be basic TSL language operators.\n\n\nCells:\n    \"total\" is a cell that represents the state of the signal that determines whether or not the vending machine can perform certain tasks.\n    \"e\" is a cell that represents the state of the signal that determines how the vending machine should act.\nFunctions:\n\nPredicates:\n    isLessThanPoint75(total) => is the total less than 0.75?\n    isLessThanOne(total) => is the total less than 1?\n    isLessThanOnePoint25(total) => is the total less than 1.25?\n    pressD(e) => did the user press the d key?\n    pressQ(e) => did the user press the q key?\n    pressO(e) => did the user press the o key?\n    press1(e) => did the user press the 1 key?\n    press2(e) => did the user press the 2 key?\n    press3(e) => did the user press the 3 key?\n    pressR(e) => did the user press the r key?\n\n\nNatural language description:\n\n\nUse the metaphor of a user pushing buttons with the result that choices in operating a vending machine are produced. The choices for operating the vending machine are: purchasing product option 1 by pressing the 1 key/button as long as the machine's total dollar amount is 0.75 or greater, purchasing product option 2 by pressing the 2 key/button as long as the machine's total dollar maount is 1 or greater, purchasing product option 3 by pressing the 3 key/button as long as the machine's total dollar amount is 1.25 or greater, inserting a dime into the machine by pressing the d key/button, inserting a quarter into the machine by pressing the q key/button, inserting a dollar into the machine by pressing the o key/button, or refunding your money by pressing the r key/button. No two machine operations can be performed at the same time.\n\n\n\nAssumptions:\n\n1. There are seven buttons, named pressD, pressQ, pressO, press1, press2, press3, and pressR, which can be pushed by the user.\n\nGuarantees:\n\n2. When pressD is pushed, the system ensures that the vending machine's value will be incremented by 0.1. This is achieved by writing the value \"total + 0.1\" to the variable \"total\".\n\n3. When pressQ is pushed, the system ensures that the vending machine's value will be incremented by 0.25. This is achieved by writing the value \"total + 0.25\" to the variable \"total\".\n\n4. When pressO is pushed, the system ensures that the vending machine's value will be incremented by 1. This is achieved by writing the value \"total + 1\" to the variable \"total\".\n\n5. When press1 is pushed, the system ensures that the vending machine's value will be decremented by 0.75 if and only if the vending machine's value is 0.75 or greater, otherwise nothing happens. This decrementing is achieved by writing the value \"total - 0.75\" to the variable \"total\".\n\n6. When press2 is pushed, the system ensures that the vending machine's value will be decremented by 1 if and only if the vending machine's value is 1 or greater, otherwise nothing happens. This decrementing is achieved by writing the value \"total - 1\" to the variable \"total\".\n\n7. When press3 is pushed, the system ensures that the vending machine's value will be decremented by 1.25 if and only if the vending machine's value is 1.25 or greater, otherwise nothing happens. This decrementing is achieved by writing the value \"total - 1.25\" to the variable \"total\".\n\n8. When pressR is pushed, the system ensures that the vending machine's value will be set to zero. This is achieved by writing the value of \"0\" to the variable \"total\". \n\n",
