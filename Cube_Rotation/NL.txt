Assumptions:

1. The system must assume that the left and right buttons are never pressed at the same time.

Guarantees:

2. If the left button is pressed, the cube should begin rotating to the left. This rotation should continue until the right button is pressed.

3. Similarly, if the right button is pressed, the cube should rotate to the right until the left button is pressed.

4. This specification ensures that the cube's rotation direction can be controlled smoothly and accurately by the user, without conflicts between the controls.
