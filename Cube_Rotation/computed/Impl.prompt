A system environment has the following API. Using the API, implement the following methods in JavaScript. The methods are divided into two categories, "functions" and "predicates". "functions" can be arbitrary functions, but "predicates" always return a boolean.

Remember that you have sample code base and paper in your knowledge base.

Functions and predicates to implement:


Cells:
  "cube" is a cell that represents the state of the signal that determines how the cube should move

Functions:
  rotateLeft(cube) => returns a new cube signal that has the cube.rotation.y value increased
  rotateRight(cube) => returns a new cube signal that has the cube.rotation.y value decreased

Predicates:
  pressL(e) => does the user press the left arrow key on their keyboard? You need to add an event listener in the function to listen for the keydown event.
  pressR(e) => does the user press the right arrow key on their keyboard? You need to add an event listener in the function to listen for the keydown event.

System API:


/*

Get or set the y position of the cube in 3D through three.js by changing "cube.rotation.y".

*/
