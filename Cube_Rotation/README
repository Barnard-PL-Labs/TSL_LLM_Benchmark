This is a complete benchmark for the Cube_Rotation example.

However, it is not a working benchmark, as the generated spec and function and predicate terms have some errors that wasn't able to be resolved.

Cube_Rotation dir example spec:

always assume{
	! (pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee{
	pressL(e) -> ([cube.rotation.y <- cube.rotation.y + 0.1] W pressR(e));
    pressR(e) -> ([cube.rotation.y <- cube.rotation.y - 0.1] W pressL(e));
}
