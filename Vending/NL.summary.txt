Use the metaphor of a user pushing buttons with the result that choices in operating a vending machine are produced. The choices for operating the vending machine are: purchasing product option 1 by pressing the 1 key/button as long as the machine's total dollar amount is 0.75 or greater, purchasing product option 2 by pressing the 2 key/button as long as the machine's total dollar maount is 1 or greater, purchasing product option 3 by pressing the 3 key/button as long as the machine's total dollar amount is 1.25 or greater, inserting a dime into the machine by pressing the d key/button, inserting a quarter into the machine by pressing the q key/button, inserting a dollar into the machine by pressing the o key/button, or refunding your money by pressing the r key/button. No two machine operations can be performed at the same time.
