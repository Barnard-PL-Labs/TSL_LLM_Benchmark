always guarantee{
//when you press the up button, count increments every frame
    pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];
//when you are not pressing the up button, count stays at 0.5
    !(pressUp(e)) -> [count <- 0.5];
//the scale value along the x axis is eventually updated with the count value
    F [cube.scale.x <- count];
