A system environment has the following API. Using the API, implement the following methods in [[LANGUAGE_GOES_HERE]]. The methods are divided into two categories, "functions" and "predicates". "functions" can be arbitrary functions, but "predicates" always return a boolean.

Functions and predicates to implement:


Cells:
  "cube" is a cell that represents the state of the signal that determines how large is the cube

Functions:

Predicates:
  pressUp(e) => does the user press the up arrow key on their keyboard? You need to add an event listener in the function to listen for the keydown event.

System API:


/*

Get or set the cube.scale.x in 3D by changing "cube.scale.x".

*/
