Assumptions:


Guarantees:

1. When the user presses the up button, the counter (count) increments by 1 every frame.

2. When the user is not pressing the up button, the counter (count) remains at 0.5.

3. The scale value along the x-axis (cube.scale.x) is eventually updated with the value of the counter (count).
