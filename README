TSL LLM Benchmark
=================

The files in this root directory are used for the generation of any state machine. For each particular state machine, there is a folder with the model-specific files.

Files:

1. run.py - run the TSL LLM generation process, with these options:
  a. directory - "Ball", "Shades", etc.
  b. method:
    from NL, and functions+pred term headers  
    from NL+TSL spec
    from NL+TSL spec+synthesized code 
1. Spec.prompt - gen the TSL spec from NL and functions+pred term headers
2. Impl.spec - gen the implementation, from NL summary, function+pred term headers, and the wrapper API description

Within each directory:

1. NL.txt - natural language high-level summary
2. NL.summary.txt - natural language description with clear list of requirements
3. Headers.txt - function+pred term headers to define
4. Wrapper_api.js - the wrapper api (javascript functions) that the LLM is supposed to use to implement the body of the functions + predicates
5. Spec.tsl - the hand-written spec (to be compared against the computer-generated one)
