Translate the following into a TSL specification. Remember, this is what TSL code looks like:

```
always assume{
}

always guarantee{
//rotate the cube with the value of t (increments by 1 every frame)
    [cube.rotation.y <- t];
}
```

This is a complete listing of all predicates you will need to use to create the spec. Everything else should be basic TSL language operators.
