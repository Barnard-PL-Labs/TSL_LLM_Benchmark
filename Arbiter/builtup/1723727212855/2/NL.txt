You should make 4 assumptions: every i in 1..4, truck i will eventually make a request to go across the bridge. You provide these 4 guarantees: each i in 1..4, if truck i makes a request to go across the bridge, eventually it will be granted access to the bridge. In addition, provide these 2 guarantees:
1. if 1 wins the coinflip against 4 and 3 is granted, then 1 must not be granted until 4 is
2. if 3 wins the coinflip against 1 and 4 is granted, then 3 must not be granted until 1 is
