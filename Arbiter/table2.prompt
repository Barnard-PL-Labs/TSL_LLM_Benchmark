given a number N, go into the directory "../results/by_benchmark/builtup" and search in every subdirectory, and within that the number. If there is a folder in there with name "Spec_template.prompt", so total name "../results/by_benchmark/builtup/{subdir}/{N}/Spec_template.prompt", then for each subdir, see whether the file "err.log" contains a line with the substrings "returned non-zero exit status 1" and "synthesize". Count the total number of subdirs and the total number of subdirs that do NOT have an error file with a line with the specified substrings. If error file contains a line with substrings OR there is a file "bad.txt" in the directory, then it counts as an "error". The total path would look like `"../results/by_benchmark/builtup/{subdir}/{N}/Spec_template.prompt/{subdir2}/err.log"`. In addition, look at the file "Spec.tsl" in the same dir as "err.log", and count the average number of lines that aren't blank or comments (that begin with possible whitespace and then "//"). Count this for each N across all "Spec.tsl" files that are in a successful, non-error directory.

If the script is the main script, make N a command line argument, "--n-statement". If the argument N argument is not passed, run the script for each of the N values 10, 20, and 30, and then put the results in a csv called "table2.csv" that contains 7 columns: the model, N, the number of trials (M), the number without the error, and p = (number without error) / (number of trials), and sqrt(p * (1 - p) / M), and the average number of lines in "Spec.tsl" in successful dirs.

In addition, support a command line argument "--model". If it is passed, change directory references to N to "N_{model_name}" and change the table name to "table2_{model_name}.csv"
