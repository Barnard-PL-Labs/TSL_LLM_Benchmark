You should make 4 assumptions: every i in 1..4, truck i will eventually make a request to go across the bridge. You provide these 4 guarantees: each i in 1..4, if truck i makes a request to go across the bridge, eventually it will be granted access to the bridge. In addition, provide these 3 guarantees:
1. if 1 wins the coinflip against 2 and 4 is granted, then 1 must not be granted until 2 is
2. if 1 wins the coinflip against 3 and 2 is granted, then 1 must not be granted until 3 is
3. if truck 3 is granted, 4 must not be granted until 2 is
