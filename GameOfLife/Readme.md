# Game of Life

## Notes

Be careful when defining specs, you should provide functions and predicates in such a way that the code never has to use == or ints in the TSL spec itself

Problem with the spec was that I was treating the tneire game as one state machine. Instead treat each cell as a state machine and create cells
