TSL bases of LTL (or Linear Temporal Logic). 

Temporal logic is all about using logical expressions to describes the truth values of things over time, and each expression can be evaluated as either true or false. There are the constants:

- `True`
- `False`

With those constants, we can add what’s called the logical connectives to express more complex situations:

- `&&`: logical and
- `||`: local or
- `not`: negation
- `->` implication

### Next
“X” denotes the immediate next state 
X (isHoliday); //expressed in TSL

### Globally
“G” denotes all states are true all the time
G (isHoliday);

### FINALLY 
“F” denotes that a state will eventually exist sometime in the future, but when will is happen is not determined.
F (isHoliday);

### Until
“U” denotes that A stays true up to the point when B turns true, and B is guaranteed to turn true at some point.
isHoliday U isMonday;

### Weak Until
“W” is almost equivalent to “U” except that B is not required to turn true. That is A can be true in all the states.
isHoliday W asteroidHit;

### Implies
“→” means whenever A is true, B is true. However, there are more nuances to just A being true implies that B is true:
- A’s truth value contains B’s truth value, but not vice versa.
- When A is false, B can do whatever.
wakeUpLate -> isHoliday;

### If and only if
“<->” means A and B turns true together! One side will only be true when another one is true as well.
- A’s and B’s truth value contains each other.

### Not
“!” denotes negation, which is not unique to TSL or temporal logic. However, where “!” is put matters: look out which part is actually negated.
//It is NOT the case that 
//the next day you will have a holiday.     
!(X (isHoliday));
//The next day you will NOT have a holiday.
(X !(isHoliday));
//NOT everyday is a holiday.
! (G isHoliday);
//Everyday is NOT a holiday./NO day is a holiday.
G !(isHoliday);
//an equivalent expression:
! F(isHoliday);

### F (G isHoliday) //Some day you will have holidays forever.
### G (F isHoliday) // You have holidays from time to time
### isStudent U (G graduated) // You are a student until the day you graduate
### G (inCollege -> (careless U isSenior)) // when you are in college you are careless until you become a senior
### G (isMonday -> X isTuesday) // when it is monday, the next day is always tuesday


# Here are some TSL examples

## Basic setup
always assume {

//describes inputs from the environment

}

always guarantee {

//describes how the agent react to those inputs

}

## A rotating cube
always assume{
}

always guarantee{
//rotate the cube with the value of t (increments by 1 every frame)
    [cube.rotation.y <- t];
}

## A cube on the left side that teleports to the right side when a button is pressed
always assume{
//Define the exclusive relationship between pressing the right button and the left button
    !(pressR(e) && pressL(e));
}
always guarantee{
//When right is pressed, set y position as 2 this until left is pressed
		pressR(e) -> [cube.position.y <- 2] W pressL(e);
//When left is pressed, set y position as a sin(t) value until right is pressed, where t=0 increments over time
		pressL(e) -> [cube.position.y <- sin(t)] W pressR(e);
}



Translate the following into a TSL specification. Remember, this is what TSL code looks like:

```
always assume {
  (room.somebodyEnters
    -> (! room.empty W room.somebodyLeaves)) ;
  ((room.somebodyLeaves && room.empty)
    -> (room.empty W room.somebodyEnters)) ;
  (cm.ready || cm.standby || cm.busy) ;
  (cm.ready -> (!cm.standby && !cm.busy)) ;
  (cm.standby -> (!cm.busy && !cm.ready)) ;
  (cm.busy -> (!cm.ready && !cm.standby)) ;
  ([ cm.ctrl <- turnOn() ] && cm.standby
    -> X cm.busy U ([ cm.ctrl <- makeCoffee() ] || [ cm.ctrl <- turnOff() ] R cm.ready)) ;
  ([ cm.ctrl <- turnOff() ] && cm.ready
    -> X cm.busy U ([ cm.ctrl <- turnOn() ] R cm.standby)) ;
  ([ cm.ctrl <- makeCoffee() ] && cm.ready
    -> X cm.busy U (cm.finished && ([ cm.ctrl <- makeCoffee() ] || [ cm.ctrl <- turnOff() ] R cm.ready)));
 }
always guarantee {
  room.somebodyEnters
    -> F (cm.ready W (room.somebodyLeaves && room.empty));
}
```

```
  always assume {
    //mutual exculsion for all key inputs
   ! (pressL(e) && pressR(e));
   ! (pressL(e) && pressUp(e));
   ! (pressL(e) && pressDown(e));
   ! (pressR(e) && pressUp(e));
   ! (pressR(e) && pressDown(e));
   ! (pressUp(e) && pressDown(e));
  }

always guarantee {
    //mutual exclusion for X and Y pos updates, only one is updated at a time
    pressL(e) -> (([ headX <- headX - 1] && [headY <- headY]) W (pressR(e) || pressDown(e) || pressUp(e)));
    pressR(e) -> (([ headX <- headX + 1] && [headY <- headY]) W (pressL(e) || pressDown(e) || pressUp(e)));
    pressUp(e) -> (([ headY <- headY - 1] && [headX <- headX]) W (pressR(e) || pressL(e) || pressDown(e)));
    pressDown(e) -> (([ headY <- headY + 1] && [headX <- headX]) W (pressR(e) || pressL(e) || pressUp(e))); 
}
```

```
always assume {
  //mutual exclusion for inputs
  !(eatFood && hitSelf && hitWall);
}

always guarantee {
  //if an apple is eaten: increment the score and snake length, also reset apple position to a random value
  eatFood -> ([score <- score + 1] && [tailLength <- tailLength + 1] && [appleX <- randX] && [appleY <- randY]);
	
  //if self or wall is hit: signal game over
  (hitSelf || hitWall) -> [command <- die];
	
  //if there are no collisions, nothing should change
  ! (eatFood || hitSelf || hitWall) -> ([score <- score] && [tailLength <- tailLength] && [appleX <- appleX] && [appleY <- appleY] && [command <- idle]);
}
```

Remember this is the documentation for TSL: https://www.notion.so/flaneurnah/TSL-Documentation-90fec2187e7042b2ad16a53f59251c53#5361d4438fad4c5aba36be03f52ef20a
You should not need to use '==' in the TSL spec.

This is a complete listing of all functions and predicates you will need to use to create the spec. Everything else should be basic TSL language operators. At a high level you are writing a tsl spec for an individual cell. 

Cells:
  "alive" is the cell alive
  "index" index of the cell on the grid. This is initialized in the function terms 
Functions:

Predicates:
  comeAlive(index) => are exactly 3 neighbours are living or are 2 or 3 neighbours are living?
  comeDead(index) => does the cell have less than 2 neighbours or more than 3 neighbours?
  
Natural language description: Game of Life

Every cell observes its surrounding neighbours to check whether its living area is underpopulated, overpopulated or suitable to live in. Each cell has 8 neighbours (except for the ones at the edge of the canvas). Treat each cell as a state machine. The game itself will be implemented using an external wrapper.

Assumptions:

1. comAlive and comeDead cannot both be true at the same time


Guarantees:

2. If comeAlive is true the cell comes alive 

3. If comeDead is true it dies
