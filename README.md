# TSL LLM Benchmark

This README serves as an overview of the file organization of this repository and a walkthrough of how the benchmarks operate and the how the files are interrelated.

## File Organization

**Root Directory:** The files in the root directory are used for the generation of any state machine. For each particular state machine, there is a folder with the model-specific files. The state machines created each serve as a benchmark.

-   _Impl_template.prompt_: The template to be filled in by _wrapper_template.html_ and _Headers.txt_ to create _Impl.prompt_.
-   _run.py_: Runs the program. Takes files from a benchmark folder which aren't in the _computed_ folder and creates the files of the _computed_ folder.
-   _shotPrompt.txt_: A text file which provides documentation for TSL and NL->TSL examples. This can help the model with ICL and improves NL to TSL translation.
-   _Spec_template.prompt_: The prompt template which is used as the query to the LLM in order to generate the TSL specification.

**Benchmark Folders:** The files within each folder (e.g. Ball, GameOfLife, etc.) are used to create that benchmark.

-   _NL.summary.txt_: The natural language, high-level summary of the benchmark.
-   _NL.txt_: The natural language description of the benchmark with a clear list of requirements (Assumptions & Guarantees).
-   _Headers.txt_: The function and predicate term header definitions.
-   _wrapper_template.html_: The template html file that the LLM will implement from the _Impl.js_ and _Synth.js_ files that it generates.
-   _computed_: This folder contains files generated by the LLM (this is where the benchmark part comes in).
    -   _Spec.tsl_: The TSL specification that the LLM generates.
    -   _Spec.prompt_: The prompt which is used to query the LLM for a TSL specification.
    -   _Impl.prompt_: The prompt which is used to query the LLM for a javascript implementation of the function and predicates.
    -   _Synth.js_: The javascript translation from the LLM generated TSL specification. This translation is performed by the [TSL API](https://barnard-pl-labs.github.io/tsl-api/).
    -   _<BENCHMARK_NAME>.html_: The LLM generated html implementation.

## Benchmark Walkthrough

1. _NL.txt_, _NL.summary.txt_, and _Headers.txt_ are handmade and used to fill in _Spec_template.prompt_ and create _Spec.prompt_, which is fed into the LLM.
2. The LLM outputs _Spec.tsl_, its formulation of TSL.
3. This TSL specification is passed into the [TSL API](https://barnard-pl-labs.github.io/tsl-api/) and a javascript translation is stored in _Synth.js_.
4. The handmade _Headers.txt_ is used to fill in _Impl_template.prompt_ and create _Impl.prompt_, which is fed into the LLM.
5. The LLM outputs _Impl.js_, its javascript implementation of the functions and predicates.
6. Finally, using _wrapper_template.html_, _Synth.js_, and _Impl.js_, the LLM fills in _<BENCHMARK_NAME>.html_ for the final benchmark implementation.
7. OPTIONAL: Combine steps 4-6.

### TODO: How are _wrapper_template.html_ and _Headers.txt_ used in _Impl_template.prompt_ to create _Impl.prompt_?
