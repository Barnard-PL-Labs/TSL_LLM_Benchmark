A system environment has the following API. Using the API, implement the following methods in JavaScript. The methods are divided into two categories, "functions" and "predicates". "functions" can be arbitrary functions, but "predicates" always return a boolean.

Remember that you have sample code base and paper in your knowledge base.

Functions and predicates to implement:


Cells:
  "cube" is a cell that represents the state of the signal that determines how the cube should move

Functions:
  rotateLeft(cube) => returns a signal to rotate the cube to the left
  rotateRight(cube) => returns a signal to rotate the cube to the right

Predicates:
  pressL(e) => does the user press the left arrow key on their keyboard?
  pressR(e) => does the user press the right arrow key on their keyboard?

System API:


/*

Get or set the y position of the cube in 3D through three.js by changing "cube.rotation.y".

*/
