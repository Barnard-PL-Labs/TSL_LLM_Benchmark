Translate the following into a TSL specification. Remember, this is what TSL code looks like:

Remember the TSL documentation and code that you have in your knowledge base.

```
always assume {
  (room.somebodyEnters
    -> (! room.empty W room.somebodyLeaves)) ;
  ((room.somebodyLeaves && room.empty)
    -> (room.empty W room.somebodyEnters)) ;
  (cm.ready || cm.standby || cm.busy) ;
  (cm.ready -> (!cm.standby && !cm.busy)) ;
  (cm.standby -> (!cm.busy && !cm.ready)) ;
  (cm.busy -> (!cm.ready && !cm.standby)) ;
  ([ cm <- turnOn() ] && cm.standby
    -> X cm.busy U ([ cm <- makeCoffee() ] || [ cm <- turnOff() ] R cm.ready)) ;
  ([ cm <- turnOff() ] && cm.ready
    -> X cm.busy U ([ cm <- turnOn() ] R cm.standby)) ;
  ([ cm <- makeCoffee() ] && cm.ready
    -> X cm.busy U (cm.finished && ([ cm <- makeCoffee() ] || [ cm <- turnOff() ] R cm.ready)));
}

always guarantee {
  room.somebodyEnters
    -> F (cm.ready W (room.somebodyLeaves && room.empty));
}
```

This is a complete listing of all predicates you will need to use to create the spec. Everything else should be basic TSL language operators.

Do not use any functions or predicates that are not listed here. For example, do not use rotateLeft() or rotateRight().

Cells:
  "cube" is a cell that represents the state of the signal that determines how the cube should move

Predicates:
  pressL(e) => does the user press the left arrow key on their keyboard?
  pressR(e) => does the user press the right arrow key on their keyboard?

Natural language description:


A cube is rotating by its y axis. The cube is reactive to the user input of left arrow key press and right arrow key press to change the direction it's rotating to.


Assumptions:

1. The user will never press the left key and the right key at the same time.

Guarantees:

2. When the user presses the left key, the cube will rotate to the left by its y axis weak until the user press the right key.

3. When the user presses the right key, the cube will rotate to the right by its y axis weak until the user press the left key.
