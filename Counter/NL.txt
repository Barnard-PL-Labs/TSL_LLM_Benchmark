Assumptions:

1. There are three buttons, named pressA, pressB, and pressC, which can be pushed by the user.

Guarantees:

2. When pressA is pushed, the system ensures that the counter will be incremented by stepsize, which starts at a value of 1. This is achieved by writing the value "count + stepsize" to the variable "count".

3. When pressB is pushed, the system ensures that the counter will be incremented by 2. This is achieved by writing the value "count + 2" to the variable "count".

4. When pressC is pushed, the system ensures that the counter will be incremented by 3. This is achieved by writing the value "count + 3" to the variable "count".

5. When pressA is pushed three times in a row, on the fourth time in a row that it is clicked, its increment size (stepsize) will increase by what it is times three. This is achieved by writing the value "multiplyByThree(stepsize)" to the variable "stepsize".

6. When pressB or pressC is pushed, the systems ensures that the stepsize will be set back to 1. This is achieved by writing the value "1" to the variable "stepsize".
