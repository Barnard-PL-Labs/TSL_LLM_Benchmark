Cells: 
    "stepsize" is a cell that represent the state of the signal that determines how much pressing the "a" key/button will increment the counter by. Stepsize starts at the value of 1 each program start.
    "e" is a cell that represents the state of the signal that determines how the counter should act (how much it should increment by).

Functions:
    multiplyByThree(stepsize) => multiply the stepsize by 3.

Predicates:
    pressA(e) => did the user press the a key?
    pressB(e) => did the user press the b key?
    pressC(e) => did the user press the c key?
