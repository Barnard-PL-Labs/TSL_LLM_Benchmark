Write an HTML and CSS program where there are 3 buttons:

1. Button 1 is the 'a' key on the keyboard. When clicked, it adds 1 to the counter on the screen. 
2. Button 2 is the 'b' key on the keyboard. When clicked, it adds 2 to the counter on the screen.
3. Button 3 is the 'c' key on the keyboard. When clicked, it adds 3 to the counter on the screen.

However, there is a caveat. If Button 1 (the 'a' key) is clicked 3 times in a row, then it will increment by 5 from now on if clicked again after that. If Button 1 (the 'a' key) is clicked 3 more times in a row again, then it will increment by 10 from now on if clicked again after that. If Button 1 (the 'a' key) is clicked 3 more times in a row again, then it will increment by 15 from now on if clicked again after that. This pattern continues infinitely (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, ...).

Write this program in HTML and Javascript (in the same file, use the <style> tags).

Example:
program starts: counter = 0
'a' is clicked: counter = 1
'a' is clicked: counter = 2
'a' is clicked: counter = 3
'a' is clicked: counter = 8
'a' is clicked: counter = 13
'a' is clicked: counter = 18
'a' is clicked: counter = 28
'b' is clicked: counter = 30
'a' is clicked: counter = 31
