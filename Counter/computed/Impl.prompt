Implement the following methods in [[LANGUAGE_GOES_HERE]]. The methods are divided into two categories, "functions" and "predicates". "functions" can be arbitrary functions, but "predicates" always return a boolean.

Functions and predicates to implement:

Cells: 
    "stepsize" is a cell that represents the state of the signal that determines how much the counter will increment by when pressing the "a" key/button.
    "e" is a cell that represents the state of the signal that determines how the counter should act (how much it should increment by based on which key is pressed).

Functions:

Predicates:
    pressA(e) => did the user press the a key?
    pressB(e) => did the user press the b key?
    pressC(e) => did the user press the c key?
