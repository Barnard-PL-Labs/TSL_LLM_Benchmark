A system environment has the following API. Using the API, implement the following methods in JavaScript. The methods are divided into two categories, "functions" and "predicates". "functions" can be arbitrary functions, but "predicates" always return a boolean.

Functions and predicates to implement:

Cells: 
    "stepsize" is a cell that represent the state of the signal that determines how much pressing the "a" key/button will increment the counter by.
    "e" is a cell that represents the state of the signal that determines how the counter should act (how much it should increment by).

Functions:
    multiplyByThree(stepsize) => multiply the stepsize by 3.

Predicates:
    pressA(e) => did the user press the a key?
    pressB(e) => did the user press the b key?
    pressC(e) => did the user press the c key?
