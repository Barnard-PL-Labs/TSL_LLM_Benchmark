A system environment has the following API. Using the API, implement the following methods in JavaScript.

There are some special restrictions on how you can implement the functions. The functions must be pure functions, having no side effecs. Their only effect can be to return a value. The methods are divided into two categories, "functions" and "predicates". "functions" can be arbitrary functions, but "predicates" always return a boolean. The variables are divided into three categories: inputs, outputs, and cells. In function bodies, you can use "inputs" and "cells", but you should not use "outputs".

### High level description:

A ball is bouncing between two walls. The position of the ball can be represented as a number between 0 and 10, where 0 represents that the ball is against the leftmost wall and 10 represents that it is against the rightmost wall.

### Functions and predicates to implement:

Cells:
  "ball.pos" is a cell that represents the position of the ball. the position of the ball is changed by setting this cell
Functions:
  moveLeft(ball.pos) => returns a signal to move the ball to the left
  moveRight(ball.pos) => returns a signal to move the ball to the right
Predicates:
  leftmost(ball.pos) => is the ball against the leftmost wall?
  rightmost(ball.pos) => is the ball against the rightmost wall?

### System API:

Get or set the position of the ball by changing "ball.pos"
