Assumptions:

1. The system must assume that the left and right buttons are never pressed at the same time.

Guarantees:

2. When the user presses the right key (pressR(e)), the count value increments by 0.1. This increment continues in each frame until the left key (pressL(e)) is pressed.

3. When the user presses the left key (pressL(e)), the count value decrements by 0.1. This decrement continues in each frame until the right key (pressR(e)) is pressed.

4. The rotation of the cube along the y-axis is set to the sine of twice the count value, continuously updating as count changes.

5. The rotation of a polygon along the y-axis follows a sawtooth pattern, which is calculated as the saw of 0.5 times (1 plus the count value), continuously updating as count changes.

6. The x-position of the cube is fixed at 1.

7. The x-position of the polygon is fixed at 3.
