Here's the implementation for the specified predicates in JavaScript. Since the implementations are straightforward comparison checks and event-based triggers, we can define them directly as functions. Keep in mind, as per your request, there are no external API wrappers or additional function definitions outside of what is directly needed to implement these predicates.

```javascript
// Predicate implementations for the vending machine

// Predicate definitions for the "total" cell
function isLessThanPoint75(total) {
    return total < 0.75;
}

function isLessThanOne(total) {
    return total < 1;
}

function isLessThanOnePoint25(total) {
    return total < 1.25;
}

// Predicate definitions for the "e" cell representing user input events
function pressD(e) {
    return e.key === 'd' || e.key === 'D';
}

function pressQ(e) {
    return e.key === 'q' || e.key === 'Q';
}

function pressO(e) {
    return e.key === 'o' || e.key === 'O';
}

function press1(e) {
    return e.key === '1';
}

function press2(e) {
    return e.key === '2';
}

function press3(e) {
    return e.key === '3';
}

function pressR(e) {
    return e.key === 'r' || e.key === 'R';
}
```

These JavaScript functions can be called within the context of event listeners or other handling logic that determines the value of `total` or when an event `e` occurs (such as keypress events). Each function checks if the respective condition (like a comparison or key press) is met and returns a boolean value accordingly.

To use the above predicates effectively, especially the event-based ones (`press*` functions), you would typically set them up within event listeners in a web-based JavaScript environment. Here is a basic example on how you might setup an event listener for keypress events:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
    if (pressD(event)) {
        console.log("D key pressed.");
    } else if (pressQ(event)) {
        console.log("Q key pressed.");
    } // Add similar checks for other keys
});
```

For the predicates based on the `total`, you could check these conditions when updating or receiving the `total` value:

```javascript
let total = 0.70; // an example total value
if (isLessThanPoint75(total)) {
    console.log("Total is less than 0.75.");
}
```

Make sure the contexts where you're using these predicates match your application setup and requirements.
