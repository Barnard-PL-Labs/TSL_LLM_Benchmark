always guarantee {
  (position == 10) -> F (moveLeft W (position == 0));
  (position == 0) -> F (moveRight W (position == 10));
  (!(position == 0 || position == 10)) -> F (moveLeft || moveRight);

In this TSL specification:

- Assumptions are made about the movement constraints relative to the ball's position and its motion direction constraints (left or right movements relative to its current position against the walls).
- Guarantees are ensuring the ball moves away from either wall towards the opposite direction and continues in the correct movement direction until reaching the opposite wall, adhering to the described behavior in the narrative.
