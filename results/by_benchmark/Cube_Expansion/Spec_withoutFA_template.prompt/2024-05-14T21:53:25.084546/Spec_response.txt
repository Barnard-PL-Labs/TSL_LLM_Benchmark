Here's how you would translate the given natural language description into a TSL specification:

```tsl
always assume {
    // There is no specific environment assumption to be listed here.
}

always guarantee {
    // When the user presses the up button, the counter increments by 1 every frame.
    pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

    // When the user is not pressing the up button, the counter should remain at 0.5.
    !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];

    // The scale value along the x-axis (cube.scale.x) is updated with the value of the counter.
    [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions**: There's no specific assumption about the environment stated in the problem description, so the `always assume` block remains empty.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - The first guarantee specifies that when the up key is pressed, a variable `count` (which could be a counter for the number of frames the key has been held down) is incremented by 1 every frame.
   - The second guarantee ensures that when the up key is not pressed, the `count` is reset to 0.5. This captures the functionality where the cube's scale along the x-axis returns to 0.5 when the key is not pressed.
   - The third guarantee binds the `cube.scale.x` to the value of `count`, ensuring that the cube's scale along the x-axis always reflects the current value of `count`.
