Here is the TSL specification based on your description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // No specific environmental assumptions required about external systems
}

always guarantee {
  // When the up key is pressed, increment the counter each frame
  pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];
  
  // When the up key is not pressed, reset the counter to 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];
  
  // The scale of the cube along the x-axis follows the value of count
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

This specification uses a `count` variable to track the number of frames the up key is pressed and adjusts the scale of the cube along the x-axis accordingly. When the up key is not pressed, the `count` is reset to 0.5, ensuring the cube's scale returns to its initial size.
