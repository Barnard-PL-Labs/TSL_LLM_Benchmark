To implement the predicate `pressUp(e)` that detects when the up arrow key is pressed on the keyboard, we will need to write JavaScript code that includes an event listener monitoring for `keydown` events. This predicate will return `true` when the up arrow key is detected, and `false` otherwise.

Here is how you can implement this in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Create a variable that will hold the state of the up arrow key
let isUpArrowPressed = false;

// Add an event listener to the document to listen for keydown and keyup events
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(e) {
    if (e.key === 'ArrowUp') {
        isUpArrowPressed = true; // Set the flag to true when the up arrow key is pressed
    }
});

document.addEventListener('keyup', function(e) {
    if (e.key === 'ArrowUp') {
        isUpArrowPressed = false; // Reset the flag to false when the up arrow key is released
    }
});

// Define the predicate function to check the state of the up arrow key
function pressUp() {
    return isUpArrowPressed; // Return the current state of the up arrow key
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: A variable `isUpArrowPressed` is initialized to `false`. This variable will track whether the up arrow key is currently pressed.
- **Event Listeners**: Two event listeners are added to the document:
    - **`keydown`**: This event triggers when any key is pressed down. Inside this event, we check if the key pressed is the up arrow (`'ArrowUp'`). If it is, we set `isUpArrowPressed` to `true`.
    - **`keyup`**: This event triggers when any key is released. Similarly, we check if the key released is the up arrow. If it is, we reset `isUpArrowPressed` to `false`.
- **Predicate Function**: `pressUp()` is a function that simply returns the current value of `isUpArrowPressed`, indicating whether the up arrow key is currently being pressed.

This approach ensures that the predicate reflects the real-time state of the up arrow key, suitable for reacting to user input in interactive applications.
