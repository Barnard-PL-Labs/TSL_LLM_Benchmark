To implement the predicate `pressUp(e)` in the JavaScript setting, you need first to set up a mechanism to monitor keyboard events. In this context, using an event listener to detect when the "up arrow" key is pressed will serve the purpose. Since the predicate needs to return a boolean, we will use a variable to store the state of the key (pressed or not pressed).

Here's how you can implement this setup:

```javascript
// Variable to keep track of the up arrow key state
let upKeyPressed = false;

// Function to update the key state based on keyboard events
function updateUpKeyState(event) {
    if (event.key === "ArrowUp") {
        upKeyPressed = (event.type === 'keydown');
    }
}

// Adding event listeners for keydown and keyup to track the up arrow key state
document.addEventListener('keydown', updateUpKeyState);
document.addEventListener('keyup', updateUpKeyState);

// Predicate function to check if the up arrow key is pressed
function pressUp() {
    return upKeyPressed;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Variable Initialization**: `upKeyPressed` is a boolean variable that keeps track of whether the up arrow key is currently pressed. It is initialized to `false`.

2. **Function `updateUpKeyState`**: This function is designed to handle both `'keydown'` and `'keyup'` events. It checks if the key associated with the event is the up arrow key (`ArrowUp`). If it is, the function updates the `upKeyPressed` variable to `true` when the event type is `'keydown'`, indicating the key is pressed. Conversely, it sets `upKeyPressed` to `false` when the event type is `'keyup'`, indicating the key has been released.

3. **Event Listeners**: The document registers two event listeners that call `updateUpKeyState` on `'keydown'` and `'keyup'`. This ensures that `upKeyPressed` is accurately updated whenever the up arrow key is pressed or released.

4. **Predicate `pressUp`**: This function simply returns the current state of `upKeyPressed`. It encapsulates the predicate logic for determining if the up arrow key is currently pressed.

This setup will correctly monitor and reflect the state of the up arrow key, providing a reliable mechanism to use this predicate within any system that needs to react to this particular key event.
