The TSL (Temporal Stream-based Specification Language) specification based on the description provided involves creating rules that handle the cube's scaling based on user interaction with the up key. We will define a counter that increases when the up key is pressed and resets when the key is not pressed. The cube's scale.x will be updated according to this counter.

Here is the appropriate TSL template for your description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Define the behavior of pressing the up key
  pressUp(e);
}

always guarantee {
  // When the up key is pressed, increment the counter by 1 every frame
  pressUp(e) -> ([count <- count + 1]);
  
  // When the up key is not pressed, reset the counter to 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> ([count <- 0.5]);
  
  // Update the cube's scale.x with the value of the counter
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions:** The `pressUp(e)` predicate is used to check if the up key is pressed. It's assumed to handle the event of key pressing correctly.

2. **Guarantees:**
   - When the up button is pressed (`pressUp(e)` is true), the `count` variable increments by 1 every frame. This is handled by the statement `[count <- count + 1]`.
   - When the up button is not pressed (`!pressUp(e)`), the `count` resets to 0.5 immediately. This is represented by the statement `[count <- 0.5]`.
   - Regardless of whether the button is pressed or not, the cube's scale along the x-axis (represented by `cube.scale.x`) is updated to the current `count` value. This defines the reactive behavior of the cube to the up key press.

This TSL specification effectively captures the dynamic reaction of the cube's scale based on continuous user input, according to the rules and behaviors laid out in the description.
