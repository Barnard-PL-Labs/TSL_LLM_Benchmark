Here is the TSL specification based on your description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // There's no specific environmental assumption related to external inputs other than the button press
}

always guarantee {
  // When the user presses the up button, increment the counter each frame
  pressUp(e) -> ([count <- count + 1] W !pressUp(e));

  // When the user is not pressing the up button, reset the counter to 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];

  // The scale value along the x-axis is updated with the value of the counter
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
``` 

Explanation:
- The `always assume` block is empty because the environment's behavior is straightforward without conflicts or complex conditions.
- The `always guarantee` block contains three rules:
  1. When the up button is pressed (`pressUp(e)`), the `count` variable is incremented by 1 each frame until the button is released.
  2. When the up button is not pressed (`!pressUp(e)`), the `count` variable is reset to 0.5.
  3. Independently of the press status, the `cube.scale.x` is consistently updated to the current `count` value.
