To implement the predicate `pressUp(e)` that detects if the user presses the up arrow key on the keyboard, we can utilize JavaScript's event listeners. Although the requirement outlines the predicate as a function, we must integrate it into a responsive system that updates according to keyboard events dynamically. Therefore, I will set up an event listener that listens for the 'keydown' event and updates a variable that represents the predicate's truth value.

Here is how you can implement it in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Define a variable to keep track of the up arrow key state
let isUpKeyPressed = false;

// Function to set the predicate value based on the keyboard event
function updateUpKeyState(event) {
    if (event.keyCode === 38) {  // 38 is the keyCode for the up arrow key
        isUpKeyPressed = true;
    }
}

// Function to reset the predicate value when the key is released
function resetUpKeyState(event) {
    if (event.keyCode === 38) {
        isUpKeyPressed = false;
    }
}

// Add event listeners to the document to detect when keys are pressed and released
document.addEventListener('keydown', updateUpKeyState);
document.addEventListener('keyup', resetUpKeyState);

// Function to access the state of the up key press
function pressUp() {
    return isUpKeyPressed;
}
```

### Explanations:

1. **Variable Declaration**: `isUpKeyPressed` boolean variable is used to store the current state of the up arrow key, whether it is pressed or not.

2. **Updating Key State**: The `updateUpKeyState` function listens for `keydown` events and sets `isUpKeyPressed` to `true` if the up arrow key (keyCode 38) is pressed.

3. **Resetting Key State**: The `resetUpKeyState` function listens for `keyup` events and sets `isUpKeyPressed` to `false` when the up arrow key is released. This ensures the state accurately reflects the current state of the key.

4. **Event Listeners**: We attach event listeners for both `keydown` and `keyup` events to the document. These listeners will trigger the corresponding functions to update and reset the key state.

5. **Predicate Function**: The `pressUp` function acts as a predicate to externally check the state of the up arrow key. This function returns `true` if the up arrow key is currently pressed, `false` otherwise.

This setup allows you to maintain an accurate and real-time state of the up arrow key, which can be accessed through the `pressUp` predicate function at any point in your application. This method adheres to the requirements of not using any additional API functions directly related to the cube or its properties but focuses on keyboard interaction monitoring.
