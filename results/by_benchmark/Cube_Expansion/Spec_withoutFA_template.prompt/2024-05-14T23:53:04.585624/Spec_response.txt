Here is the TSL specification based on your given description:

```plaintext
always assume {
  // No specific assumptions about environment conditions
}

always guarantee {
  // Initial scale value when the up button is not pressed
  !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];

  // When the up button is pressed, increment count by 1 each frame
  pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

  // The scale value along the x-axis follows the count value
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
``` 

This TSL code specifies the behavior of adjusting the cube's x-axis scale based on the user's interaction with the up key, aligning with the conditions described in your task.
