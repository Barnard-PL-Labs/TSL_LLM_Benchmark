Here's the corresponding TSL specification for the provided scenario:

```TSL
always assume {
  // No specific assumptions about the environment are needed for this setup
}

always guarantee {
  // When the user is not pressing the up button, the cube's scale along the x-axis should be 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- 0.5];

  // When the user presses the up button, increment the scale value along the x-axis according to a counter
  pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- count];

  // The counter increments by 1 every frame when the up button is pressed
  pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

  // When the user is not pressing the up button, the counter should reset to 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];
}
```

This TSL specification includes guarantees for the behavior of the cube's scale along the x-axis in response to user input, specifically reacting to the pressing of the up key. The count variable is used to incrementally update the scale value while the up key is pressed and reset it when not pressed.
