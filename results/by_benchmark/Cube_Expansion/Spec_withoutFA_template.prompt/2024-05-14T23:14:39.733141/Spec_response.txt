Here's the TSL specification based on the provided description:

```tsl
always assume {
    // It is assumed that pressUp(e) is well-defined and interacts with user input correctly.
    // No additional assumptions are required for functionality described.
}

always guarantee {
    // When the user presses the up button, the counter (count) increments by 1 every frame.
    pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

    // When the user is not pressing the up button, reset the counter (count) to 0.5.
    !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];

    // The cube's scale value along the x-axis is continuously updated to match the current count.
    [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions**: No specific assumptions about the system environment or interactions besides the `pressUp(e)` predicate are mentioned. Thus, the `always assume` block remains effectively empty, just noting that `pressUp(e)` should handle the user input as expected.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - When the up key is pressed (`pressUp(e)`), the counter `count` is incremented by 1 every frame. This means that for every frame where the up key is held down, `count` will increase.
   - When the up key is not pressed (`!pressUp(e)`), the counter is reset to 0.5 immediately. This guarantees that whenever the up key is released, `count` reverts to its initial value of 0.5.
   - The cube's scale along the x-axis (`cube.scale.x`) is always set to the current value of `count`. This ensures the cube's size updates in real-time according to the interactions with the up key.

This TSL specification ensures that the cube's scale x reacts dynamically to the pressing of the up key, incrementing with each frame the key is held, and resetting when the key is released.
