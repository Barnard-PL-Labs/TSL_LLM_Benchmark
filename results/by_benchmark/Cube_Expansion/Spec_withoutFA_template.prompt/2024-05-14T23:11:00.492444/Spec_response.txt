Here is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // There are no explicit environmental assumptions that affect the logic directly
}

always guarantee {
  // When the up key is pressed, increment the counter each frame
  pressUp(e) -> ([count <- count + 1]);
  
  // When the up key is not pressed, reset the counter to 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> ([count <- 0.5]);
  
  // The cube's scale along the x-axis follows the value of the counter
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Assumptions:** There are no specific conditions assumed from the environment that affect the cube's behavior, as described in the natural language input. The behavior is solely dependent on the user interactions.

- **Guarantees:**
  1. **Incremental Counter:** When the `pressUp(e)` predicate is true (i.e., the up button is pressed), the `count` variable is incremented by 1 in every frame. This is modeled by the assignment `[count <- count + 1]`.
  2. **Counter Reset:** When the up button is not pressed (`!pressUp(e)`), the counter is reset to 0.5. This ensures that the scale of the cube along the x-axis returns to its initial state when there is no user interaction.
  3. **Scale Update:** The cube's scale along the x-axis (`cube.scale.x`) is continuously updated to match the value of the `count` variable. This is done through the assignment `[cube.scale.x <- count]`, which synchronizes the cube's physical scale with the counter value. This guarantees that any changes to the counter (whether it's being incremented or reset) are directly reflected in the cube's scale.
