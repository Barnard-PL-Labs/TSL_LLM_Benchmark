Here's the TSL specification for the described behavior of the cube's scale along the x-axis in response to user interaction with the up key:

```tsl
always assume {
  // No specific assumptions about external conditions
}

always guarantee {
  // When the user presses the up button, increment a counter (count) every frame
  pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

  // When the user is not pressing the up button, reset the counter to 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];

  // The scale value along the x-axis is updated with the value of the counter
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

In this specification:
- The counter `count` is incremented by 1 every frame as long as the up key is pressed, simulating the increased scale effect.
- When the up key is not pressed, `count` is set to 0.5, which resets the scale.
- The cube's x-axis scale (`cube.scale.x`) is directly linked to the value of `count`, ensuring it reflects the current state of interaction.
