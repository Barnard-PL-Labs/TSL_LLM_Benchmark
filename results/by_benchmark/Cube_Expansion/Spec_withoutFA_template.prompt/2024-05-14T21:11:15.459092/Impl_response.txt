To implement the predicate `pressUp(e)` in JavaScript, we will need to set up an event listener that listens for keypress events and checks if the up arrow key (which corresponds to the keycode `38`) is pressed. This will determine the truth value of the predicate.

Given that your environment includes interaction with a 3D cube through setting properties like `cube.scale.x`, but no specific details on how to access or modify these properties are provided, the solution focuses only on the predicate implementation.

Below is a JavaScript implementation for the `pressUp(e)` predicate using event listeners:

```javascript
// Assuming there's a global object to keep the state of the keys
const keyState = {};

// Function to update the state when a key is pressed
function updateKeyState(event) {
    keyState[event.keyCode] = event.type === 'keydown';
}

// Adding event listeners for keydown and keyup
document.addEventListener('keydown', updateKeyState);
document.addEventListener('keyup', updateKeyState);

// Predicate function to check if the up arrow key is pressed
function pressUp() {
    // Key code 38 corresponds to the up arrow key
    return keyState[38] === true;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Global State (`keyState`)**: An object is used to track which keys are currently pressed down. The keys are stored by their keycode, and the value is `true` if the key is currently pressed, otherwise it is not defined or `false`.

2. **Event Listeners**: Two event listeners are added to the document. They listen for `keydown` and `keyup` events. When a key is pressed down, a `keydown` event is triggered, setting the corresponding keycode in `keyState` to `true`. When the key is released, a `keyup` event sets the value back to `false`.

3. **Predicate Function (`pressUp`)**: This function checks the state of the `keyState` object to determine if the up arrow key (keycode `38`) is currently being pressed. It returns `true` if the key is pressed, otherwise `false`.

This implementation provides a straightforward way to check if the up arrow key is pressed at any given time by calling the `pressUp` function, which will evaluate the current state based on the most recent key events.
