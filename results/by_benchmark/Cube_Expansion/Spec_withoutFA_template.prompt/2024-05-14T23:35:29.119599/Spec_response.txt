Here is the TSL specification based on the natural language description provided:

```tsl
always assume{
}

always guarantee{
    // Initialize the counter to 0.5 when the user is not pressing the up button
    !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];
    
    // When the user presses the up button, increment the counter by 1 each frame
    pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];
    
    // The cube's scale along the x-axis is updated with the value of the counter
    [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

This TSL code defines the behavior of the cube's scaling in response to user input from the up arrow key. It ensures that the `count` variable, which represents the scale factor along the x-axis, is properly managed based on the state of the up key press and continuously updates `cube.scale.x` accordingly.
