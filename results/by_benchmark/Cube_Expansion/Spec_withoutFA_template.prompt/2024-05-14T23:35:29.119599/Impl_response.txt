To implement the temporal logic specifications using the provided API in a JavaScript environment, you need to focus on the predicate part only, as per your instruction to avoid functions and implement only predicates.

For the predicate `pressUp(e)`, which checks if the user presses the up arrow key on their keyboard, you will need to set up an event listener on the `document` object to listen for `keydown` and `keyup` events. This will allow you to update the state that determines whether the up key is currently being pressed.

Here is how you can implement this in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Define a variable to track the state of the up arrow key
let upKeyPressed = false;

// Add an event listener for the 'keydown' event to detect when the up arrow key is pressed
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(e) {
    if (e.key === "ArrowUp") {
        upKeyPressed = true;
    }
});

// Add an event listener for the 'keyup' event to detect when the up arrow key is released
document.addEventListener('keyup', function(e) {
    if (e.key === "ArrowUp") {
        upKeyPressed = false;
    }
});

// Predicate function to check if the up arrow key is pressed
function pressUp() {
    return upKeyPressed;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Variable Initialization**: `upKeyPressed` is a boolean variable initialized to `false`. It serves as the state holder for whether the up arrow key is currently pressed.

2. **Event Listeners**: Two event listeners are added to the `document`:
   - The `keydown` event sets `upKeyPressed` to `true` if the pressed key is the up arrow (`ArrowUp`).
   - The `keyup` event sets `upKeyPressed` to `false` when the up arrow key is released.

3. **Predicate Function `pressUp`**: This function returns the current state of `upKeyPressed`, effectively indicating whether the up arrow key is pressed at the time the function is called.

With this setup, `pressUp()` will serve as a predicate that can be used in your temporal logic specifications to determine actions based on whether the up arrow key is pressed. This fits into the TSL framework by providing a real-time, boolean-returning predicate reflecting user interaction.
