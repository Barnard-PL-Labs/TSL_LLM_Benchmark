Here's the TSL specification that matches your description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // No specific assumptions are required for environment interaction in this case
}

always guarantee {
  // When the user presses the up button, the counter (count) increments by 1 every frame
  pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

  // When the user is not pressing the up button, the counter (count) returns to 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];

  // The scale value along the x-axis (cube.scale.x) is continuously updated with the value of the counter (count)
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

This TSL specification incorporates the following logic:
1. The `pressUp(e)` predicate checks if the up key is pressed.
2. If the up key is pressed, the counter `count` is incremented by 1 every frame.
3. If the up key is not pressed, the counter `count` is reset to 0.5.
4. Regardless of the user input state, the cube's scale along the x-axis (`cube.scale.x`) is always updated to match the current value of `count`.
