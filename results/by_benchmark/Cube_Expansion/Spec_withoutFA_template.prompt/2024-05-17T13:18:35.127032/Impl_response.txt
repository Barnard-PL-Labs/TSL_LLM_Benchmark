To implement the `pressUp(e)` predicate in JavaScript, we need to add an event listener to the document to listen for `keydown` events and check if the key pressed is the up arrow key. We will define a variable to track the state of the up arrow key (whether it's pressed or not) and update this variable based on the key events.

Since the requirement specifies that we should not implement any functions, I will directly set up the event listeners in the script and use a variable to maintain the state of the up arrow key.

Here is the JavaScript code to implement the `pressUp(e)` predicate:

```javascript
// Variable to track the state of the up arrow key
let isUpKeyPressed = false;

// Event listener for the 'keydown' event
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
    if (event.key === "ArrowUp") {
        isUpKeyPressed = true;
    }
});

// Event listener for the 'keyup' event
document.addEventListener('keyup', function(event) {
    if (event.key === "ArrowUp") {
        isUpKeyPressed = false;
    }
});

// Code to simulate the usage of the predicate
// The 'setInterval' function is used here just to demonstrate the state of the predicate.
// In a real application, you would use `isUpKeyPressed` wherever the predicate condition needs to be checked.
setInterval(() => {
    console.log("Is the UP key pressed? ", isUpKeyPressed);
}, 1000);
```

### Explanation:
1. **Variable Initialization:**
   - `isUpKeyPressed` is a boolean variable initialized to `false`. It serves as the state holder for whether the up arrow key is pressed.

2. **Event Listeners:**
   - Two event listeners are added to the document:
     - A `keydown` event listener sets `isUpKeyPressed` to `true` when the up arrow key is detected.
     - A `keyup` event listener sets `isUpKeyPressed` to `false` when the up arrow key is released.

3. **Demonstration Code:**
   - The `setInterval` function is used here just for demonstration purposes to periodically check and print the state of the up arrow key. In practical scenarios, the `isUpKeyPressed` variable would be checked in the logic where the predicate condition (whether the up arrow key is pressed) needs to be evaluated.

This setup will ensure that the predicate `pressUp(e)` correctly reflects the state of the up arrow key being pressed in the application.
