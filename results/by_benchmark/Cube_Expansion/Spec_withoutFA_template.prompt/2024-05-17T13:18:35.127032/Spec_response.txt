Here is the TSL specification based on the given scenario:

```tsl
always assume{
}

always guarantee{
    // When the up button is pressed, increment the counter by 1 every frame
    pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];
    
    // When the up button is not pressed, reset the counter to 0.5
    !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];
    
    // Update the cube's scale along the x-axis with the value of count
    [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Assumptions**: There are no specific environment assumptions provided in the scenario, so the `always assume` block is empty.

- **Guarantees**:
  1. **Increment Counter**: When the user presses the up key (`pressUp(e)`), the `count` variable increments by 1 every frame. This is depicted by the statement `[count <- count + 1]`.
  2. **Reset Counter**: When the up key is not pressed (`!pressUp(e)`), the `count` is reset to 0.5. This reset occurs immediately when the key release condition is true.
  3. **Update Cube's Scale**: The cube's scale along the x-axis (`cube.scale.x`) is continuously updated to match the value of `count`. This ensures that the scale of the cube reflects the duration for which the up key has been pressed, with an immediate reset when the key is released.
