To implement the predicate `pressUp(e)` in JavaScript, which checks if the user presses the up arrow key on their keyboard, you can use an event listener for the `keydown` event. This predicate will interact with the system to potentially trigger reactions based on the key press, but will not directly modify any values or call any other functions according to the constraints provided.

Here is an example of how you can implement this in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Create a variable to track the state of the up arrow key
let isUpKeyPressed = false;

// Function to update the state when the up arrow key is pressed
function updateKeyPressState(event) {
    if (event.key === "ArrowUp") {
        isUpKeyPressed = true;
    } else if (event.key === "ArrowDown") {
        isUpKeyPressed = false;
    }
}

// Add event listeners to track key down and key up events
document.addEventListener("keydown", function(event) {
    if (event.key === "ArrowUp") {
        isUpKeyPressed = true;
    }
});

document.addEventListener("keyup", function(event) {
    if (event.key === "ArrowUp") {
        isUpKeyPressed = false;
    }
});

// Predicate function to check if the up arrow key is pressed
function pressUp() {
    return isUpKeyPressed;
}

// Example usage: Log the state of the 'pressUp' predicate
setInterval(() => {
    console.log("Is Up Arrow Key Pressed?", pressUp());
}, 1000);  // Checks and logs the state every 1 second
```

### Explanation:
1. **Global Variable**: `isUpKeyPressed` is used to store the state of the up arrow key. It is initially set to `false`.

2. **Event Listeners**: Two event listeners are added to the document:
   - A `keydown` listener that sets `isUpKeyPressed` to `true` when the up arrow key is pressed.
   - A `keyup` listener that sets `isUpKeyPressed` to `false` when the up arrow key is released.

3. **Predicate Function**: `pressUp()` simply returns the current value of `isUpKeyPressed`, which reflects whether the up arrow key is currently pressed.

4. **Example Usage**: An interval is set to log the state of the `pressUp()` function every second. This is just for demonstration and testing purposes to see the predicate in action.

This implementation meets the requirement of creating a predicate (`pressUp`) that returns a boolean indicating whether the up arrow key is pressed, using event listeners to track and update the key's state dynamically.
