Here's the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description and the structure of TSL code:

```tsl
always assume {
    // Here we assume necessary conditions about environment, but none specific is stated
}

always guarantee {
    // Guarantee that when the up button is not pressed, the counter remains at 0.5
    !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];

    // Guarantee that when the up button is pressed, the counter increments by 1 each frame
    pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

    // The scale value along the x-axis is updated with the value of the counter
    [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

This specification captures the behavior of the cube scaling in reaction to the `pressUp` event, with the scale returning to a default when the key is not pressed and incrementally increasing when the key is pressed. The counter resets to 0.5 when the up key is not pressed, ensuring the cube's scale returns to its initial state.
