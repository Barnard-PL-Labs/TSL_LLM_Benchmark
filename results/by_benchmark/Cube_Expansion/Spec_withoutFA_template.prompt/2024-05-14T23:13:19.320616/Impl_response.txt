To implement the predicate `pressUp(e)` that checks if the user has pressed the up arrow key on their keyboard, we'll use JavaScript to add an event listener to the document. This listener will react to `keydown` events. The predicate will be represented through a variable that tracks whether the up arrow key is currently being pressed. We will not implement any functions as per your request, focusing solely on this predicate.

Here's how you can implement this in JavaScript:

```javascript
// This variable will represent the state of the up arrow key
let isUpKeyPressed = false;

// Adding an event listener to the document for the 'keydown' event
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
    if (event.key === 'ArrowUp') {
        isUpKeyPressed = true;
    }
});

// Adding an event listener to the document for the 'keyup' event
document.addEventListener('keyup', function(event) {
    if (event.key === 'ArrowUp') {
        isUpKeyPressed = false;
    }
});

// Predicate function to check if the up arrow key is pressed
function pressUp() {
    return isUpKeyPressed;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Variable `isUpKeyPressed`**: This variable holds a boolean value, indicating whether the up arrow key is currently pressed (`true`) or not (`false`).

2. **Event Listeners**:
   - The `keydown` event listener sets `isUpKeyPressed` to `true` when the up arrow key is pressed.
   - The `keyup` event listener resets `isUpKeyPressed` to `false` when the up arrow key is released.

3. **Function `pressUp`**: This function simply returns the value of `isUpKeyPressed`. It acts as a predicate to check the current state of the up arrow key.

This setup ensures that the state of the up arrow key is accurately tracked and can be queried at any point using the `pressUp` function, which corresponds to the predicate in the TSL context. This function can be integrated into any system that needs to react based on the up arrow key input.
