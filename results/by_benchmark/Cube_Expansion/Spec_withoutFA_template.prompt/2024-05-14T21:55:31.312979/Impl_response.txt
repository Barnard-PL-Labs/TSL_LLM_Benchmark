To implement predicates in JavaScript, especially for capturing user interactions such as key presses, you'll typically use event listeners. Here, you are asked to implement a predicate `pressUp(e)` to check if the user presses the up arrow key on their keyboard.

Since this is a predicate, it's expected to return a boolean value: `true` when the up arrow key is pressed, and `false` otherwise. However, directly implementing this as a function that immediately returns a boolean upon key press requires a subtly different approach, typically involving the setting of a flag.

Below, I'll provide an example implementation in JavaScript where we use a global variable to track the state of the up arrow key. This approach involves setting an event listener for key presses and releases to update this flag.

Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
// Flag to track the state of the up arrow key
let isUpKeyPressed = false;

// Function to be called when the key is pressed
function handleKeyDown(event) {
    if (event.key === "ArrowUp") {
        isUpKeyPressed = true;
    }
}

// Function to be called when the key is released
function handleKeyUp(event) {
    if (event.key === "ArrowUp") {
        isUpKeyPressed = false;
    }
}

// Setting up event listeners for the keydown and keyup events
document.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
document.addEventListener('keyup', handleKeyUp);

// Predicate function to check if the up arrow key is pressed
function pressUp() {
    return isUpKeyPressed;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Global Variable (`isUpKeyPressed`)**: This variable holds the state of the up arrow key. It's initially set to `false` and gets updated based on key events.

2. **Event Listeners**: Two event listeners are set up to listen for `keydown` and `keyup` events. They call `handleKeyDown` and `handleKeyUp` respectively.

3. **Handling Key Events**:
   - **`handleKeyDown`**: This function checks if the pressed key is the up arrow (`ArrowUp`). If it is, it sets `isUpKeyPressed` to `true`.
   - **`handleKeyUp`**: This function checks if the released key is the up arrow. If it is, it sets `isUpKeyPressed` to `false`.

4. **Predicate Function (`pressUp`)**: This function simply returns the current state of `isUpKeyPressed`, allowing other parts of your application to check if the up arrow key is currently pressed.

This setup uses a straightforward approach to track and respond to specific key events in real-time, making the `pressUp` function effectively act as a predicate within the confines of JavaScript's event-driven model.
