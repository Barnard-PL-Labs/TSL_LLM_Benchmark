To implement a predicate `pressUp(e)` that checks whether the up arrow key is pressed on a user's keyboard, we would use JavaScript along with appropriate event listeners. Below is how this can be implemented without defining any custom functions, as per your request.

### JavaScript Implementation

This implementation assumes that we are working within an environment where `document` is available, such as in a web browser.

```javascript
// Assuming a setup where we can add event listeners to the document
document.addEventListener('keydown', (event) => {
    if (event.key === 'ArrowUp') {
        // Here we assume there is a way to communicate to the system that pressUp() is true
        // Since no functions can be defined, direct interaction or state change needs to be handled by existing API or framework
        console.log('Up arrow key pressed'); // Placeholder for the predicate being true
    }
});

document.addEventListener('keyup', (event) => {
    if (event.key === 'ArrowUp') {
        // Handle the case when the up arrow key is released
        console.log('Up arrow key released'); // Placeholder for the predicate being false
    }
});
```

### Explanation

1. **Event Listeners**: The script sets up event listeners for `keydown` and `keyup` events on the `document`. This allows the script to react when keys on the keyboard are pressed and released.
   
2. **Checking the Key**: Inside the event listeners, the script checks if the key involved in the event is the up arrow key (`ArrowUp`). This is done by comparing `event.key` against the string `'ArrowUp'`.

3. **Handling State**: When the up arrow key is pressed, the script logs a message to the console as a placeholder action. This would typically be where you integrate with the system API to indicate that `pressUp` is true. Similarly, another log is made when the key is released, indicating where you would reset the state.

### Limitations and Integration Points

- **Direct API Integration**: In a real application, instead of logging to the console, you would directly manipulate or signal the system's state according to your specifications or APIs. For example, setting some state variable or calling an API function.
  
- **No Custom Functions**: As per the instructions not to use or implement any functions, this code directly embeds logic inside event listeners. In a typical application, you might encapsulate behavior in functions for clarity and reuse.

- **Environment Assumptions**: This code assumes it's running in a web browser environment where `document` is available for attaching event listeners. This may not be applicable in non-web environments.

This setup should adequately handle the detection of the up arrow key being pressed and can be integrated or expanded based on the specific requirements and available APIs of the system.
