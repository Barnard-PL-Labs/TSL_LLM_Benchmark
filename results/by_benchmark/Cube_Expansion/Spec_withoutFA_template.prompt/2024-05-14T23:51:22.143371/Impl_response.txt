In the TSL (Temporal Stream Logic) template, we'll create predicates to represent the behavior of a cube's scale and the pressing of an up arrow key in a system environment. Note that since TSL is a logical specification language used primarily for defining conditions over time, we won't be implementing JavaScript functions; rather, we'll specify what should happen in response to the system inputs and states.

We will define the TSL template based on the provided predicate requirements:

```tsl
always assume {
    // PressUp predicate is true when the up arrow key is pressed
    (pressUp(e) -> (X pressUp(e))) ;  // Assuming 'e' represents event data that is continuously provided by the system environment.

    // Here, we are assuming the cube's scale along the x-axis can change in response to certain system inputs or controls, though not explicitly defined here.
}

always guarantee {
    // Ensure that when the up arrow key is pressed, the cube's x scale becomes a certain value, say 2. This is an arbitrary value for demonstration.
    pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- 2];

    // When the up arrow key is not pressed, the cube's x scale returns to 1 (or any other base value).
    !pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- 1];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions**:
   - The `pressUp(e)` predicate is continually checked for the press of an up arrow key. The transition to the next state (denoted by `X`) assumes `pressUp(e)` will also be true in the next state if it is true now, indicating that the key press state is continuously checked or maintained.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - When the up arrow key is detected (`pressUp(e)` being true), we dictate that the system must set `cube.scale.x` to 2.
   - Conversely, when the up arrow key is not pressed, `cube.scale.x` resets to a default value of 1.

These TSL specifications can be used within a system that translates TSL into executable system checks and updates, thereby controlling the cube's behavior in response to keyboard input. The specific values for the cube's scale are illustrative and can be adjusted based on actual application requirements or system capabilities.
