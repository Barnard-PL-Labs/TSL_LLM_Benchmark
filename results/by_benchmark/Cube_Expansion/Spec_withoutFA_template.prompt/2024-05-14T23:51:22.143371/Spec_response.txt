Here's the TSL specification that represents the behavior of a cube which scales along the x-axis in reaction to the up key being pressed, based on the description provided:

```tsl
always assume{
    // No specific assumptions needed regarding the environment.
}

always guarantee{
    // When the up key is pressed, increment the counter each frame.
    pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];
    
    // When the up key is not pressed, reset the counter to 0.5.
    !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];
    
    // Update the cube's scale along the x-axis with the value of the counter.
    [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

This specification uses a counter (`count`) to track the scaling factor of the cube along the x-axis (`cube.scale.x`). When the up key (`pressUp(e)`) is pressed, the counter is incremented each frame, reflecting continuous pressing. When the up key is not pressed, the counter is set to 0.5, which represents the cube's default scale along the x-axis when the up key is not engaged. The scale of the cube is continuously updated to match the value of the counter, ensuring the cube responds to user inputs as described.
