Here is the TSL specification based on the provided description:

```tsl
always assume{
  // No specific environmental assumptions are stated explicitly
}

always guarantee{
  // When the user presses the up button, increment the counter by 1 every frame
  pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

  // When the user is not pressing the up button, set the counter to 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];

  // The scale value along the x-axis of the cube is updated to match the counter value
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

This specification captures the dynamic scaling of the cube's x-axis in response to the user pressing the up key, leveraging a counter that updates per frame and resets when the key is not pressed.
