Here is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description:

```tsl
always assume {
}

always guarantee {
  // When the user is not pressing the up button, the counter (count) remains at 0.5.
  !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];

  // When the user presses the up button, the counter (count) increments by 1 every frame.
  pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

  // The scale value along the x-axis (cube.scale.x) is eventually updated with the value of the counter (count).
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```
