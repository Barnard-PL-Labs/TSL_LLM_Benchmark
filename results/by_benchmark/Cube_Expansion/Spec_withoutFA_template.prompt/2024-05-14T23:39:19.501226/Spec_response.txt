To translate the given natural language description into a TSL specification, we need to first define the predicates, assumptions, and guarantees based on the behavior of the cube's scale in response to the user's input (pressing the up key).

```tsl
always assume {
  // No specific environmental assumptions beyond input conditions
}

always guarantee {
  // Count holds the value for scaling the cube on the x-axis.
  // When the up key is pressed, increment the value of count each frame.
  pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

  // When the up key is not pressed, reset count to 0.5.
  !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];

  // The cube's scale along the x-axis is updated with the value of count.
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions**: No explicit environmental assumptions are needed for this scenario as it directly handles input from the user. The assumption section remains empty in this case.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - When the up key is pressed (`pressUp(e)`), the counter variable `count` increments by 1 each frame. This is modeled by the assignment `[count <- count + 1]`.
   - When the up key is not pressed (`!pressUp(e)`), the counter is reset to a baseline value of 0.5, done via `[count <- 0.5]`.
   - The cubeâ€™s x-axis scale (`cube.scale.x`) is always updated to reflect the current value of `count`, ensuring that the cubeâ€™s size changes reactively as specified.

This TSL specification describes the dynamic interaction between the up key input and the cube's scaling behavior, ensuring that the cube responds immediately and correctly to changes in user input.
