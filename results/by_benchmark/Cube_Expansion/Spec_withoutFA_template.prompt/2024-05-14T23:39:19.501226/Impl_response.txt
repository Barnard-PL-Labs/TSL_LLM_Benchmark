To implement the specified predicates using JavaScript, you need to create a function that listens for keyboard events and checks if the up arrow key is pressed. Here is a sample implementation that follows the requirements:

### JavaScript Implementation

1. **`pressUp(e)` Predicate:**
   - This function will check if the 'up arrow' key (keyCode: 38) is pressed.
   - We will add an event listener to the window object to listen for keydown events.
   - The function will return `true` if the up arrow key is pressed, and `false` otherwise.

### Implementation Code:

```javascript
// Setting up a variable to track the state of the up arrow key
let isUpKeyPressed = false;

// Event listener for keydown
window.addEventListener('keydown', function(e) {
    if (e.keyCode === 38) {  // 38 is the keyCode for the up arrow key
        isUpKeyPressed = true;
    }
});

// Event listener for keyup
window.addEventListener('keyup', function(e) {
    if (e.keyCode === 38) {
        isUpKeyPressed = false;
    }
});

// Predicate function to check if the up key is pressed
function pressUp() {
    return isUpKeyPressed;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Event Listeners:** Two event listeners are added to the `window` object. One listens for `keydown` events and the other for `keyup` events. When the up arrow key is pressed down, the `isUpKeyPressed` variable is set to `true`, and when the key is released, it is set to `false`.
- **Predicate Function `pressUp()`:** This function returns the current state of the `isUpKeyPressed` variable. It returns `true` if the up arrow key is currently pressed, otherwise `false`.

### Usage Example:
You can test the predicate function by calling it within any part of your application where you need to check the state of the up arrow key.

```javascript
setInterval(() => {
    console.log("Is Up Key Pressed? ", pressUp());
}, 1000);  // Check the state every 1000 milliseconds (1 second)
```

This setup integrates seamlessly with the browser's event handling mechanism to track and respond to specific key events, fulfilling the requirement for the predicate to detect up arrow key presses.
