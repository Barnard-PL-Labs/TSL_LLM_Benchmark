It seems there is a misunderstanding in the request. Implementing JavaScript functions or event listeners directly would be outside the scope of TSL (Temporal Stream Logic) which is used for defining specifications in reactive systems. However, I can help you create a TSL specification that assumes the behavior of the predicate `pressUp(e)` interacting with a cube's scale in a hypothetical environment where such interaction is modeled.

Here's how you can define a TSL template for the scenario where pressing the "up" arrow key affects the cube's scale along the x-axis, assuming that there exists a mechanism to detect the key press and that the cube's scale is adjusted accordingly.

```tsl
always assume {
    // Define the behavior of the pressUp predicate
    pressUp(e); // This would be true whenever the "up" arrow key is pressed
}

always guarantee {
    // When the "up" arrow key is pressed, adjust the cube's scale along the x-axis
    pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- cube.scale.x + 0.1];
}
```

In this TSL specification:

- The `always assume` block is assuming that the `pressUp(e)` predicate correctly identifies when the "up" key is pressed.
- The `always guarantee` block specifies that whenever `pressUp(e)` is true, the cube's scale along the x-axis (`cube.scale.x`) is increased by 0.1 units.

This specification could be part of a reactive system where the actual detection of the key press and the manipulation of the cube's scale are handled by the underlying system or framework that interprets the TSL and interacts with the environment (e.g., a 3D rendering engine or a physical simulation). 

If you need actual JavaScript implementation for handling key presses and manipulating object properties (like in a 3D environment using Three.js or similar), you would typically use event listeners and direct manipulation of object properties rather than TSL.
