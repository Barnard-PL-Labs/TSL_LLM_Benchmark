To implement the predicate `pressUp(e)` in JavaScript, you need to set up an event listener that listens for the "keydown" event and checks if the pressed key is the up arrow key. Since you requested that this be implemented without any functions, I'll provide an example of how this could be embedded directly within a class or script without defining additional helper functions. Here, I'll assume you want this predicate to be integrated into a system that might look like an application or a game loop.

Here's a basic structure of how this might be implemented:

```javascript
class Application {
    constructor() {
        this.isUpKeyPressed = false; // This variable acts as the predicate

        // Event listeners to update the state
        window.addEventListener('keydown', (event) => {
            if (event.key === 'ArrowUp') {
                this.isUpKeyPressed = true;
            }
        });

        window.addEventListener('keyup', (event) => {
            if (event.key === 'ArrowUp') {
                this.isUpKeyPressed = false;
            }
        });
    }

    // Method to check if up arrow key is currently pressed
    pressUp() {
        return this.isUpKeyPressed;
    }

    // Example of a function that might be part of your game loop or application logic
    update() {
        if (this.pressUp()) {
            console.log("Up arrow key is pressed.");
            // Add logic here to respond to the key press
            // For instance, moving an object upwards in a game
        }
    }

    // More methods and application logic can go here

    // Run the application loop or similar
    run() {
        // This could be a game loop or simply a method that's called repeatedly
        setInterval(() => {
            this.update();
        }, 100); // Update at 10 frames per second
    }
}

// Usage
const app = new Application();
app.run();
```

### Explanation:
1. **Constructor**: Initializes the state and sets up event listeners for keydown and keyup events. It toggles the `isUpKeyPressed` state based on whether the up arrow key is pressed or released.

2. **pressUp Method**: Acts as a predicate that returns `true` if the up arrow key is pressed, otherwise `false`. This directly checks the state variable `isUpKeyPressed`.

3. **update Method**: An example method that might be called as part of your main application or game loop. It uses `pressUp()` to check the state of the up arrow key and act accordingly.

4. **run Method**: Sets up a simple interval to simulate a running application or game loop, calling the `update` method in a regular interval.

This setup ensures that the `pressUp` predicate is integrated into the structure of an application, making it easy to work with in a more extensive system that might involve more complex interactions or additional input handling.
