Here's how you might translate the given natural language description into a TSL specification:

```tsl
always assume {
  // No assumptions specific to environment behavior specified
}

always guarantee {
  // The counter should reset to 0.5 when the up button is not pressed
  !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];

  // When the up button is pressed, increment the counter each frame
  pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

  // The scale of the cube along the x-axis follows the value of the counter
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

This TSL specification captures the described behavior:

1. **Counter Reset**: When the up key is not pressed, the `count` variable is reset to 0.5.
2. **Incremental Increase**: When the up key is pressed, the `count` increases by 1 for each frame as long as the key remains pressed.
3. **Scale Update**: The cube's x-axis scale (`cube.scale.x`) is continuously updated to match the value of `count`.
