Here is the TSL specification based on the description provided:

```tsl
always assume {
  // No specific environmental assumptions are needed for the pressUp(e) interaction
}

always guarantee {
  // When the user presses the up button, the counter (count) increments by 1 every frame
  pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

  // When the user is not pressing the up button, the counter (count) remains at 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];

  // The scale value along the x-axis (cube.scale.x) is eventually updated with the value of the counter (count)
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

This TSL specification handles the cube's reaction to the user's input (pressing the up key), managing the scale along the x-axis by directly linking it to a counter that updates based on the key press state.
