Here is the TSL specification based on your provided natural language description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // No assumptions specified regarding external conditions or predicates
}

always guarantee {
  // When the user is not pressing the up button, the counter should be reset to 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];

  // When the user presses the up button, increment the counter by 1 each frame
  pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

  // The scale value along the x-axis is set to the current value of the counter
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
``` 

This specification makes use of two main guarantees: 
1. Resetting the counter to 0.5 when the up key is not pressed, ensuring the cube's scale returns to its initial state.
2. Incrementing the counter when the up key is pressed, which dynamically increases the scale of the cube along the x-axis as long as the key is held down.

Additionally, it constantly updates the scale of the cube based on the value of the counter, fulfilling the requirement that cube.scale.x is reactive to the changes in count.
