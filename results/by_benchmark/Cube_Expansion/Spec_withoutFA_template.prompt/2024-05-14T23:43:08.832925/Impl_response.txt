To implement the required predicates in JavaScript, we will focus on setting up an event listener to track whether the 'Up' arrow key is pressed. Since we are directly returning a boolean based on the input event, we will use a global variable to store the state of the key press. This will allow us to track the state across different checks.

Here's how you can implement this in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Global variable to track the state of the 'Up' arrow key
let isUpKeyPressed = false;

// Function to initialize event listeners for keyboard interactions
function setupKeyPressListeners() {
  // Listen for the 'keydown' event to detect when keys are pressed
  document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
    if (event.key === 'ArrowUp') {
      isUpKeyPressed = true;  // Set to true when 'Up' key is pressed
    }
  });

  // Listen for the 'keyup' event to detect when keys are released
  document.addEventListener('keyup', function(event) {
    if (event.key === 'ArrowUp') {
      isUpKeyPressed = false;  // Set to false when 'Up' key is released
    }
  });
}

// Predicate to check if the 'Up' arrow key is currently pressed
function pressUp() {
  return isUpKeyPressed;
}

// Initialize the key press listeners when the page is ready
setupKeyPressListeners();
```

### Explanation:
1. **Global Variable (`isUpKeyPressed`)**: This variable keeps track of whether the 'Up' arrow key is being pressed. It is updated based on keyboard events.

2. **`setupKeyPressListeners` Function**:
   - This function sets up the event listeners for both the 'keydown' and 'keyup' events.
   - When the 'keydown' event detects that the 'Up' arrow key is pressed (`event.key === 'ArrowUp'`), it sets `isUpKeyPressed` to true.
   - Conversely, when the 'keyup' event detects that the 'Up' arrow key is released, it sets `isUpKeyPressed` to false.

3. **`pressUp` Predicate**:
   - This is a simple function that returns the current state of `isUpKeyPressed`, indicating whether the 'Up' arrow key is pressed.

4. **Initialization**:
   - The `setupKeyPressListeners` function is called to initialize the event listeners, ensuring that the keyboard interactions are tracked from when the page loads.

This setup ensures that your JavaScript code can correctly identify and react to the 'Up' arrow key being pressed, integrating smoothly with other parts of your application where you might need to check this condition.
