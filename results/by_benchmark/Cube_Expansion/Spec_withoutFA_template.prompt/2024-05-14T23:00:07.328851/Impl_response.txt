To implement the predicate `pressUp(e)` in JavaScript that detects when the user presses the up arrow key and interacts with a hypothetical cube object in a 3D system, you can follow these steps. This predicate will specifically check for the "up" arrow key press and modify the scale of the cube along the x-axis.

Firstly, note that you will need to setup an event listener on the document object to listen for "keydown" events. Based on your request, we will use this event to check if the up arrow (which corresponds to the key code 38) is pressed.

Here is a basic implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Assuming 'cube' is the 3D object and it has a property scale.x
let cube = {
    scale: {
        x: 1 // Initial scale of the cube along the x-axis
    }
};

// Function to check for the up arrow key press
function pressUp(e) {
    return e.keyCode === 38; // Key code for the up arrow key
}

// Event listener for keydown events on the document
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(e) {
    if (pressUp(e)) {
        console.log("Up arrow key is pressed.");
        cube.scale.x += 0.1; // Increase the cube's scale along x-axis for demonstration
        console.log(`Cube's new x scale: ${cube.scale.x}`);
    }
});

// Optionally, to demonstrate or debug, you might want to log the current scale of the cube
document.addEventListener('keyup', function(e) {
    if (e.keyCode === 38) { // Only when the up arrow key is released
        console.log(`Current scale of cube along x-axis: ${cube.scale.x}`);
    }
});
```

### Explanation:
1. **Cube Object**:
   - An object `cube` represents the 3D model. It includes a nested object `scale` with a property `x` which is the scale of the cube along the x-axis.

2. **Predicate Function `pressUp`**:
   - This function takes an event object `e` as its parameter and checks if the up arrow key (key code 38) has been pressed. It returns `true` if the up key is pressed, otherwise `false`.

3. **Event Listeners**:
   - `keydown`: This listener triggers when any key is pressed. Inside this, it checks if the up arrow key was pressed by calling `pressUp(e)`. If true, it increments the x-axis scale of the cube.
   - `keyup`: This is used to log the cube's scale when the up arrow key is released, which can be helpful for debugging or demonstration purposes in a development environment.

This code will dynamically respond to user input from the keyboard and modify the scale of the cube accordingly, demonstrating a basic interaction within a 3D system environment. Adjustments to the amount by which the scale changes (`cube.scale.x += 0.1`) can be made based on the requirements or how noticeable you want the scale change to be.
