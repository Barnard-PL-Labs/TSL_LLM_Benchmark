Here is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // This area is typically used for assumptions about the environment, no specific assumptions provided here.
}

always guarantee {
  // When the up button is pressed, increment the counter each frame
  pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];
  
  // When the up button is not pressed, set the counter to 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];
  
  // The cube's scale along the x-axis follows the value of the counter
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

This TSL specification follows the requirements:

1. It handles incrementing the counter based on whether the 'up' key is being pressed.
2. It ensures that when the 'up' key is not pressed, the counter is reset to 0.5.
3. It continuously updates the scale of the cube along the x-axis based on the value of the counter.
