To implement the predicates using JavaScript, you would typically attach event listeners to the document or a specific element to capture key events and then check if the relevant key (in this case, the up arrow key) was pressed. However, since the implementation requires not using any JavaScript functions and utilizing the system API, I'll focus on outlining how this would typically be structured within the constraints provided.

### Explanation on Implementing `pressUp(e)`

Since I cannot write JavaScript functions per the instruction, I'll describe how `pressUp(e)` would be implemented in a typical scenario where functions are allowed:

1. **Listening to Key Events**: You would need to listen for `'keydown'` events on the document or a specific element. This is done by attaching an event listener that triggers a function whenever a key is pressed.

2. **Checking the Key Code**: Inside the event listener's callback function, you would check if the key pressed is the up arrow key. This can be identified by checking the `keyCode` or `key` property of the event object, where the up arrow key corresponds to `keyCode` 38 or `key` 'ArrowUp'.

3. **Setting Predicate State**: Based on whether the up key was pressed or not, you would then set the state of a boolean variable (which acts as the predicate) to `true` or `false`. This boolean represents the predicate `pressUp(e)`.

4. **Usage in System**: This boolean can then be used within your system to react accordingly, for example, moving an object upwards in a game or scrolling up in a UI.

### Hypothetical TSL Template Integration

If we were to integrate this into a TSL system as a predicate without implementing any JavaScript, it would be described as an assumption or a guarantee based on environmental interaction. However, the actual checking of key presses must be handled by JavaScript functions normally, as the TSL itself does not interact with hardware or user input directly. Here’s how you might conceptualize it in a TSL-like logic, assuming the system could handle JS-like interaction:

```plaintext
always assume {
  // This would hypothetically check if the up arrow key is pressed
  pressUp(e);
}

always guarantee {
  // React to the up arrow key being pressed, like moving an object up
  pressUp(e) -> [object.position.y <- object.position.y + 1];
}
```

Since we're restricted from using actual JavaScript functions in this explanation and TSL doesn’t directly manage real-time user inputs, the above is a high-level conceptual approach. For real implementation, JavaScript or another programming language capable of event handling would be necessary.
