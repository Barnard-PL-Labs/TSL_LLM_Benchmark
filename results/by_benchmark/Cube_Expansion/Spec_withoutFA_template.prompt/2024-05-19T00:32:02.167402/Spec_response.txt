Here is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description and predicates:

```tsl
always assume{
  // No specific environmental assumptions provided for pressing keys
}

always guarantee{
  // When the up key is not pressed, the counter is set to 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];

  // When the up key is pressed, increment the counter by 1 each frame
  pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

  // Update the cube's scale along the x-axis with the value of the counter
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

Explanation:

1. **Assumptions**: There are no specific environmental assumptions required for the pressing of keys based on the description provided.

2. **Guarantee 1**: When the up button (represented by the predicate `pressUp(e)`) is not being pressed, the counter (`count`) is reset to 0.5.

3. **Guarantee 2**: When the up button is pressed, the counter increments by 1 every frame, reflecting continuous input while the key is held down.

4. **Guarantee 3**: The value of `count` is always used to set the scale of the cube along the x-axis, making the cube's scale reactive to changes in the counter value, which is influenced by the up key's state. 

This specification ensures that the cube's scale along the x-axis responds dynamically to the user's input, increasing when the up key is pressed and resetting when it is not.
