To address your request, I will provide a Temporal Stream Logic (TSL) template that incorporates the provided predicates into the system environment that manages the cube's scaling based on keyboard input (specifically, the up arrow key).

Since you mentioned that the predicates should be implemented using JavaScript's event listeners for key presses, I'll provide a TSL template that reflects this logic, though actual JavaScript code for event listeners won't be included as per your instruction to avoid implementing functions.

### TSL Template for Cube Scaling via Keyboard Interaction:

```tsl
always assume {
    // Define the relationship between pressing the up arrow key and the cube's scaling
    // Predicate pressUp(e) is true when the up arrow key is pressed
}

always guarantee {
    // The cube's x-axis scale increases when the up arrow key is pressed
    pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- cube.scale.x + 1];

    // The cube's x-axis scale remains the same when the up arrow key is not pressed
    !pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- cube.scale.x];
}
```

### Explanation:
**Assumptions Section:**
- The assumption section is kept simple because the predicate `pressUp(e)` inherently contains the necessary logic to detect the up arrow key press. It assumes a correct and exclusive detection of the key press condition.

**Guarantees Section:**
- When the predicate `pressUp(e)` is true (i.e., the up arrow key is pressed), the cube’s x-axis scale is incremented by one unit. This reflects an immediate response to the key press.
- When the predicate `pressUp(e)` is false (i.e., the up arrow key is not pressed), the cube’s x-axis scale remains unchanged. This ensures that the scaling only happens upon the specific interaction.

This TSL template is conceptual and assumes that the `pressUp(e)` predicate is effectively detecting the up arrow key press and that the system can handle the variable update for `cube.scale.x`. Actual implementation of the predicates in JavaScript would involve event listeners and state management to track and update these values based on user interactions.
