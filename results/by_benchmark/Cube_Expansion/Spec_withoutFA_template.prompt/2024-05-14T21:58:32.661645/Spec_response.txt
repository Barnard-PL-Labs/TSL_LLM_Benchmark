Here is a TSL specification that matches the description provided:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Assumptions are minimal in this case as we're mainly reacting on user input
}

always guarantee {
  // When the up button is pressed, increment the counter each frame
  pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

  // When the up button is not pressed, reset the counter to 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];

  // Update the cube's scale along the x-axis with the value of the counter
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

This TSL code ensures that:
1. The counter `count` is incremented by 1 for every frame the `up` button is pressed.
2. When the `up` button is not pressed, the counter `count` is reset to 0.5.
3. The scale of the cube along the x-axis (`cube.scale.x`) is continuously set to the current value of `count`.
