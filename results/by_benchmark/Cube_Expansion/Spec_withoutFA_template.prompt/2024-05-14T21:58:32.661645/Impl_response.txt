To implement the predicate `pressUp(e)` in JavaScript, we need to track whether the up arrow key has been pressed on the keyboard and use this information to determine the truth value of the predicate. This involves adding an event listener to detect key presses and a mechanism to store the state of the up arrow key press.

Here is how you can implement this functionality in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Object to store the state of keys
const keyStates = {
    upArrowPressed: false
};

// Function to initialize key listeners
function initializeKeyListeners() {
    // Listener for keydown event
    document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
        if (event.key === "ArrowUp") {
            keyStates.upArrowPressed = true;
        }
    });

    // Listener for keyup event
    document.addEventListener('keyup', function(event) {
        if (event.key === "ArrowUp") {
            keyStates.upArrowPressed = false;
        }
    });
}

// Predicate to check if the up arrow key is pressed
function pressUp() {
    return keyStates.upArrowPressed;
}

// Initialize key listeners when the document is ready
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', initializeKeyListeners);
```

### Explanation:

1. **Key State Tracking**: We use a `keyStates` object to keep track of whether the up arrow key is currently pressed down. This object has a property `upArrowPressed` that is set to `true` when the key is pressed and `false` when it is released.

2. **Event Listeners**: Two event listeners are added to the document:
   - `keydown` listener: It checks if the key pressed is the up arrow (`ArrowUp`). If it is, it sets the `upArrowPressed` property to `true`.
   - `keyup` listener: It also checks for the up arrow key, but it sets the `upArrowPressed` property to `false` when the key is released.

3. **Predicate Function `pressUp`**: This function returns the current state of the `upArrowPressed` property, indicating whether the up arrow key is currently pressed.

4. **Initialization**: The key listeners are set up after the document content is fully loaded, ensuring that the event listeners are properly attached.

This implementation allows you to use `pressUp()` function as a predicate within your system to check the status of the up arrow key press dynamically.
