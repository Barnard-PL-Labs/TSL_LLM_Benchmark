Here's the corresponding TSL specification for the provided natural language description of the cube's behavior based on user input (pressing the up key):

```tsl
always assume {
    // This area is typically for environmental constraints, which are not specified in this case.
}

always guarantee {
    // Maintain the counter at 0.5 when the up key is not pressed
    !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];

    // Increment the counter by 1 every frame when the up key is pressed
    pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

    // The scale value along the x-axis is updated with the value of the counter
    [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Assumptions**: There are no specific environmental assumptions defined, so that section is left empty.
2. **Guarantees**:
   - The first guarantee ensures that when the up key is not being pressed, the counter 'count' remains at 0.5.
   - The second guarantee states that when the up key is pressed, the 'count' is incremented by 1 every frame. This is indicated by the temporal increase in 'count' whenever `pressUp(e)` is true.
   - The third guarantee updates the cube's scale along the x-axis (`cube.scale.x`) to the current value of 'count'. This is a direct assignment that depends on the value of `count`, showcasing a reactive update linked to the user interaction.

This TSL specification aligns with the behavior described where the cube's scaling responds dynamically to the pressing and releasing of the up key, using a counter to manage the scale transitions.
