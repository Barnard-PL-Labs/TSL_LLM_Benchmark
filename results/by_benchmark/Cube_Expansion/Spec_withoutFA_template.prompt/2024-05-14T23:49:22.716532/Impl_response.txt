To implement the necessary predicates in JavaScript for the given system environment, we'll create a simple setup to determine if the user presses the up arrow key on their keyboard. As instructed, we will not be using or implementing any additional functions, just the required predicates.

Firstly, we'll need to set up an event listener to listen for key presses. We'll use the 'keydown' event to detect when the up arrow key (which has the keyCode 38) is pressed, and the 'keyup' event to reset the predicate's state when the key is released.

Hereâ€™s how you can implement the `pressUp(e)` predicate:

```javascript
// Create an object to keep track of the key states
const keyStates = {
  upArrowPressed: false
};

// Event listener for keydown event to detect when the up arrow key is pressed
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(e) {
  if (e.keyCode === 38) {  // 38 is the keyCode for the up arrow key
    keyStates.upArrowPressed = true;
  }
});

// Event listener for keyup event to reset the state when the up arrow key is released
document.addEventListener('keyup', function(e) {
  if (e.keyCode === 38) {
    keyStates.upArrowPressed = false;
  }
});

// Predicate function to check if the up key is pressed
function pressUp() {
  return keyStates.upArrowPressed;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Key State Tracking**: We use an object `keyStates` to keep track of whether the up arrow key is pressed. This object holds a boolean `upArrowPressed` that gets updated based on key events.

2. **Event Listeners**: 
   - The `keydown` listener checks if the key pressed is the up arrow key (keyCode 38). If it is, it sets `upArrowPressed` to true.
   - The `keyup` listener checks if the key released is the up arrow key. If it is, it sets `upArrowPressed` to false.

3. **Predicate Function**: `pressUp()` is a function that returns the current state of `upArrowPressed`, indicating whether the up arrow key is currently being pressed.

This setup ensures that whenever you call the `pressUp()` function, it accurately reflects whether the up arrow key is pressed at that moment. This predicate can be used within any larger system or setup that requires knowing the up arrow key's state.
