Here's the TSL specification for the provided scenario regarding the cube's scale change based on user input:

```tsl
always assume {
  // There are no specific environmental assumptions indicated.
}

always guarantee {
  // When the user presses the up button, increment the count each frame
  pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];
  
  // When the user is not pressing the up button, reset count to 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];
  
  // The scale of the cube along the x-axis always matches the value of count
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions**: There are no specific assumptions about the environment that need to be explicitly stated in the `always assume` block.

2. **Guarantee 1**: When the user presses the up key, the counter (`count`) increments by 1 each frame. This is ensured by the assignment `[count <- count + 1]` under the condition `pressUp(e)`.

3. **Guarantee 2**: When the user is not pressing the up key, the counter is reset to 0.5, as shown by `[count <- 0.5]` under the condition `!pressUp(e)` (negation of pressing up).

4. **Guarantee 3**: The scale of the cube along the x-axis is continuously set to the value of `count`, thus following the changes in `count` as specified by the other two guarantees. This keeps the cube's scale responsive to the key press in real-time.
