To implement the predicate `pressUp(e)` within the context of a JavaScript environment that interacts with a 3D cube using an API, you'll need to manage user input through event listeners. Since you specified that the predicates must return a boolean and that we should not implement any functions, I will focus on setting up the required event listener to detect when the up arrow key is pressed.

Here is how you can implement this using JavaScript:

```javascript
// We will assume we have access to some global object "cube" for 3D manipulations

// Create a variable to track the state of the up arrow key
let isUpKeyPressed = false;

// Add an event listener to the whole window to listen for keydown events
window.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
    // Check if the key pressed is the up arrow key
    if (event.key === 'ArrowUp') {
        isUpKeyPressed = true;
    }
});

// Add another event listener for keyup to reset the state when the key is released
window.addEventListener('keyup', function(event) {
    if (event.key === 'ArrowUp') {
        isUpKeyPressed = false;
    }
});

// Predicate to check if the up key is currently pressed
function pressUp() {
    return isUpKeyPressed;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Variable Declaration**: `isUpKeyPressed` is a boolean variable initialized to `false`. It serves to track whether the up arrow key is currently pressed.

2. **Event Listeners**: Two event listeners are attached to the `window` object.
    - The first listens for `keydown` events. If the up arrow key (`ArrowUp`) is pressed, `isUpKeyPressed` is set to `true`.
    - The second listens for `keyup` events. It resets `isUpKeyPressed` to `false` when the up arrow key is released.

3. **Predicate Function**: `pressUp()` is a simple function (acting as a predicate) that returns the value of `isUpKeyPressed`. This function will return `true` if the up arrow key is currently pressed, and `false` otherwise.

### Usage:
To use this setup in your application, you would call the `pressUp()` function whenever you need to check if the up arrow key is pressed. This could be integrated into animation loops, event handling logic, or other interactive components of your system. Remember that this setup is only suitable if the application has control over the entire window or if the environment where this script will be used does not have any conflicting key handling logic.
