To implement the predicate `pressUp(e)` in JavaScript, you need to attach an event listener to the `window` object that listens for the "keydown" event. This listener will check if the pressed key is the up arrow key. Below is the implementation code for the predicate described:

```javascript
// Create a variable to track the state of the up arrow key
let isUpKeyPressed = false;

// Attach an event listener to listen for keydown events
window.addEventListener('keydown', (event) => {
    if (event.key === "ArrowUp") {
        isUpKeyPressed = true;
    }
});

// Attach an event listener to listen for keyup events
window.addEventListener('keyup', (event) => {
    if (event.key === "ArrowUp") {
        isUpKeyPressed = false;
    }
});

// Predicate function to check if the up key is pressed
function pressUp() {
    return isUpKeyPressed;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Variable Declaration:**
   - `isUpKeyPressed`: A boolean variable initialized to `false`. This variable keeps track of whether the up arrow key is currently pressed.

2. **Event Listeners:**
   - `keydown` Listener: Checks if the key pressed is the up arrow key (`ArrowUp`). If it is, it sets `isUpKeyPressed` to `true`.
   - `keyup` Listener: Checks if the key released is the up arrow key. If it is, it sets `isUpKeyPressed` to `false`.

3. **Predicate Function:**
   - `pressUp()`: Returns the current state of `isUpKeyPressed`, indicating whether the up key is currently pressed.

This implementation provides a way to determine the state of the up arrow key at any time by calling the `pressUp()` function, as required by the predicate specification.
