To implement the `pressUp(e)` predicate in JavaScript, which detects if the user presses the up arrow key on their keyboard, you will need to use an event listener to listen for the `keydown` event. Below is an example implementation using the given requirements. This code snippet assumes that you have a way to check the state of the key press asynchronously since predicates in temporal logic should not have side effects like setting values or changing states directly but rather checking conditions.

Here, I will outline how to set up the event listener and how to define a flag that will help check the state of the up arrow key press.

```javascript
// Variable to keep track of whether the up key is currently pressed
let isUpKeyPressed = false;

// Setting up event listeners for keydown and keyup events to track the up arrow key state
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
    if (event.key === "ArrowUp") {
        isUpKeyPressed = true; // Set the flag to true when the up key is pressed
    }
});

document.addEventListener('keyup', function(event) {
    if (event.key === "ArrowUp") {
        isUpKeyPressed = false; // Reset the flag when the up key is released
    }
});

// Predicate function to check if the up key is pressed
function pressUp() {
    return isUpKeyPressed; // Returns true if the up key is currently pressed, otherwise false
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Event Listeners**: The `keydown` and `keyup` event listeners are attached to the `document`. This allows us to capture key press events regardless of which element is focused in the page.

2. **Key State Management**: 
   - When the up arrow key (`ArrowUp`) is pressed down, the `keydown` event triggers setting `isUpKeyPressed` to `true`.
   - When the up arrow key is released, the `keyup` event triggers resetting `isUpKeyPressed` to `false`.

3. **Predicate Function `pressUp()`**: This function serves as a predicate by returning the boolean state of `isUpKeyPressed`, effectively indicating whether the up arrow key is being pressed at the call time.

This setup ensures that the temporal component of the system can check the state of the up arrow key at any given time by calling `pressUp()`, conforming to the typical behavior expected in a predicate within the context of temporal logic specifications.
