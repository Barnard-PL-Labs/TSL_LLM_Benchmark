To translate the provided natural language description into a TSL specification, we will define the behavior of a cube's scale on the x-axis in response to the pressing of the up key. Here's the TSL code based on your requirements:

```plaintext
always assume {
    // No specific assumptions about the environment are stated
}

always guarantee {
    // When the up button is pressed, increment a counter (count) by 1 every frame
    pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

    // When the up button is not pressed, set the counter (count) to 0.5
    !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];

    // The cube's scale along the x-axis is updated with the value of the counter (count)
    [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Assumptions**: No assumptions are defined about the environment, as none are specified in the description.

2. **Guarantees**:
    - The first rule in the guarantee section describes that when the up key (`pressUp(e)`) is pressed, a counter variable (`count`) is incremented by 1 each frame. This simulates the continuous scaling effect while the key is held down.
    - The second rule sets the counter (`count`) back to 0.5 whenever the up key is not being pressed. This ensures the scale resets.
    - The third rule continuously updates the cube's scale along the x-axis (`cube.scale.x`) to match the current value of `count`. This link ensures that the visual scale of the cube responds immediately and directly to the changes in the counter, whether being incremented or reset to 0.5. 

This setup ensures that the cube reacts dynamically to user input while maintaining a default state when no input is provided.
