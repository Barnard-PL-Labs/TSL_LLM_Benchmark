Here is the TSL specification based on your description:

```tsl
always assume {
    // No specific assumptions needed for external environment behavior
}

always guarantee {
    // Initialize the counter and the scale of the cube when not pressing the up key
    !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5] && [cube.scale.x <- 0.5];
    
    // When the up button is pressed, increment the counter by 1 each frame and update cube.scale.x
    pressUp(e) -> (X [count <- count + 1]) && [cube.scale.x <- count];
    
    // When the up button is released, reset the counter and scale back to 0.5
    !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5] && [cube.scale.x <- 0.5];
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Assumptions**: 
   - This section is left empty because the system behavior doesn't depend on any environmental conditions that need to be explicitly stated or assumed. 

2. **Guarantees**:
   - **Not pressing the up key**: When the user is not pressing the up key, the counter (`count`) is set to `0.5`. Simultaneously, the cube's scale along the x-axis (`cube.scale.x`) is also set to `0.5`.
   - **Pressing the up key**: If the user presses the up key, the counter incrementally increases by `1` in each subsequent frame (`X [count <- count + 1]`). The scale of the cube along the x-axis is updated to match the value of `count`.
   - **Releasing the up key**: When the up key is released, both the counter and the cube's scale are immediately reset to `0.5`.

This specification ensures that the cube reacts dynamically to the user's input, incrementally changing its scale as long as the up key is pressed and resetting once the key is released.
