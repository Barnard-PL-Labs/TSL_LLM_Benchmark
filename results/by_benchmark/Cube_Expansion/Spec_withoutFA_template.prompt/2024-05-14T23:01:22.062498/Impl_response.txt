To implement the `pressUp(e)` predicate in JavaScript, we need to add an event listener that listens for the 'keydown' and 'keyup' events on the document. This allows us to track if the up arrow key (which has a keyCode of 38) is pressed or released. We'll also use a boolean variable to store the state of the up key.

Here is how you can implement this in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Variable to keep track of the up key state
let isUpKeyPressed = false;

// Function to check if the up key is pressed
function checkUpKeyPress(event) {
    if (event.keyCode === 38) { // 38 is the keyCode for the up arrow key
        isUpKeyPressed = true;
    }
}

// Function to check if the up key is released
function checkUpKeyRelease(event) {
    if (event.keyCode === 38) {
        isUpKeyPressed = false;
    }
}

// Adding event listeners to the document
document.addEventListener('keydown', checkUpKeyPress);
document.addEventListener('keyup', checkUpKeyRelease);

// Predicate function to get the state of the up key
function pressUp() {
    return isUpKeyPressed;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Variable Declaration**: `isUpKeyPressed` is used to store the current state of the up arrow key, initially set to `false`.

2. **Event Listener Functions**: 
   - `checkUpKeyPress`: This function sets `isUpKeyPressed` to `true` when the up arrow key is pressed.
   - `checkUpKeyRelease`: This function resets `isUpKeyPressed` to `false` when the up arrow key is released.

3. **Event Listeners**: We add event listeners for both 'keydown' and 'keyup' events. These listeners will trigger the respective functions to update `isUpKeyPressed` based on the user's interaction with the up arrow key.

4. **Predicate Function**: `pressUp` returns the current state of `isUpKeyPressed`, aligning with the requirement of the predicate returning a boolean indicating if the up arrow key is pressed.

This implementation allows you to use the `pressUp()` function anywhere in your code to check if the up arrow key is currently being pressed, which can be particularly useful in various interactive applications or games.
