Here is the TSL specification based on the description provided:

```
always assume {
    // Define the exclusive relationship between pressing and not pressing the up button
    !(pressUp(e) && !pressUp(e));
}

always guarantee {
    // When the up button is pressed, increment the count each frame
    pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

    // When the up button is not pressed, reset the count to 0.5
    !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];

    // Continuously update the cube's scale.x with the current count
    [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions**: We assume there cannot be a concurrent state of pressing and not pressing the up button, which is a logical necessity but specified here for completeness.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - When the up button is pressed (`pressUp(e)`), the counter `count` is incremented by 1 every frame. This is handled by continuously updating the value of `count` while the condition holds true.
   - When the up button is not pressed (`!pressUp(e)`), the counter `count` is reset to 0.5, ensuring the cube's scale returns to its initial state.
   - The cube's scale along the x-axis (`cube.scale.x`) is continually updated to reflect the value of `count`, ensuring that the cube's size reacts dynamically to the user interaction.
