Here is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description and predicates:

```tsl
always assume {
  // No explicit environmental assumptions provided that need to be described in TSL
}

always guarantee {
  // When the up button is not pressed, the counter remains at 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];

  // When the up button is pressed, increment the counter by 1 each frame
  pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

  // The scale value along the x-axis is updated with the value of the counter
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

This specification ensures that:
1. When the `up` key is not pressed, the counter is reset and maintained at 0.5.
2. When the `up` key is pressed, the counter increments by 1 every frame to represent continuous pressing.
3. The cube's scale along the x-axis (`cube.scale.x`) is constantly synced with the value of the counter.
