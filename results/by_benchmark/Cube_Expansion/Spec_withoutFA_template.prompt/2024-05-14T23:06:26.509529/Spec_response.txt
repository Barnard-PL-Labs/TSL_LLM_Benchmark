Here is the TSL specification based on your description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // No specific assumptions about the environment or other conditions
}

always guarantee {
  // Initialize cube.scale.x to 0.5 when the up key is not being pressed
  !pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- 0.5];

  // When the up key is pressed, increment count every frame and update cube.scale.x with count
  pressUp(e) -> ([count <- count + 1] && [cube.scale.x <- count]);

  // When the up key is released, reset count to 0.5 and immediately set cube.scale.x to 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> ([count <- 0.5] && [cube.scale.x <- 0.5]);
}
```

Explanation:
1. The specification does not include explicit assumptions, focusing solely on guaranteeing specific behaviors based on the key press status.
2. The guarantees are:
   - When the up key is not pressed, `cube.scale.x` is set to 0.5.
   - While the up key is pressed, a counter (`count`) increments by 1 each frame, and `cube.scale.x` is updated to this counter value.
   - When the up key is released, both `count` and `cube.scale.x` are reset to 0.5 to reflect the initial scale.
