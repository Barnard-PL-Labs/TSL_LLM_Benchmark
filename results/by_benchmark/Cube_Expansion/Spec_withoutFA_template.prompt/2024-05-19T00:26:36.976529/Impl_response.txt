Since the request asks for implementing predicates without using any additional functions, we can directly translate the predicate `pressUp(e)` to check if the user has pressed the up arrow key. JavaScript can handle this using event listeners and a boolean flag to represent the state of the up arrow key. Below is a TSL template and a corresponding JavaScript implementation to handle this situation within the given constraints.

### TSL Template - Assumptions and Guarantees
Given that the functions are part of broader system behavior interacting with a 3D environment, here's how it could be structured in TSL:

```tsl
always assume {
  // No specific assumptions for external inputs other than the user pressing keys
}

always guarantee {
  // Guarantee to monitor the up arrow key press and update cube.scale.x accordingly (hypothetical)
  pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- updatedScale];
}
```

### JavaScript Implementation
In JavaScript, we'll set up an event listener on the `keydown` and `keyup` events to check for the up arrow key (key code 38). We'll maintain a boolean flag `isUpPressed` that will be true when the up arrow key is pressed and false otherwise.

```javascript
// This boolean will hold the state of the up arrow key
let isUpPressed = false;

// Function to check if the up key is pressed
function checkUpKeyPress(event) {
    if (event.keyCode === 38) {  // 38 is the keyCode for the up arrow key
        isUpPressed = true;
    }
}

// Function to reset the up key press state when the key is released
function checkUpKeyRelease(event) {
    if (event.keyCode === 38) {
        isUpPressed = false;
    }
}

// Add event listeners to the document for keydown and keyup
document.addEventListener('keydown', checkUpKeyPress);
document.addEventListener('keyup', checkUpKeyRelease);

/**
 * A predicate function that returns true if the up key is currently pressed.
 * This function meets the requirements of being a predicate.
 */
function pressUp() {
    return isUpPressed;
}
```

### Additional Note:
- If the system also involves adjusting `cube.scale.x` based on the up key press, this logic would need to be incorporated within the event listener functions or elsewhere in the application logic, depending on how `updatedScale` is determined.
- In TSL, since we cannot implement JavaScript functions directly, the `pressUp(e)` call simulates the predicate check by assuming there's an external process or thread constantly updating the `isUpPressed` flag in accordance with the actual keyboard state.
