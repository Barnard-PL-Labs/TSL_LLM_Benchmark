Here is the TSL specification based on the given natural language description for reactive behavior of a cube's scale along the x-axis in response to the up key press:

```tsl
always assume {
  // No specific environmental assumptions needed for this scenario
}

always guarantee {
  // When the up key is pressed, increment the counter each frame
  pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

  // When the up key is not pressed, reset the counter to 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];

  // The scale value along the x-axis is updated with the value of the counter
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

This TSL specification guarantees that:
1. The counter increments by 1 every frame while the up key is pressed.
2. The counter resets to 0.5 whenever the up key is not being pressed.
3. The cube's scale along the x-axis consistently matches the value of the counter.
