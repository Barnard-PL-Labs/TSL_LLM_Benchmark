always assume {
  // Assume this environment predicate is handled by external JavaScript code that sets
  // a boolean signal 'pressUp' based on the 'keydown' event for the up arrow key.
  
  // This would be implemented in JavaScript as:
  // document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
  //   pressUp = (event.keyCode === 38);
  // });

  // Here, we are just assuming the signal's presence and its correctness.
  pressUp(e) is a boolean signal; // This represents the state of the up arrow key being pressed.
