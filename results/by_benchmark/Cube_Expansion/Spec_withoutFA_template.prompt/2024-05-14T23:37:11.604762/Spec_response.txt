Here is the TSL specification based on your description:

```tsl
always assume {
    // Defines the behavior of the up button press.
    pressUp(e);
}

always guarantee {
    // When the up button is pressed, increment the counter each frame.
    pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

    // When the up button is not pressed, reset the counter to 0.5.
    !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];

    // The scale value of the cube along the x-axis is updated with the value of the counter.
    [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

In this TSL specification:
- The `always assume` section specifies the behavior related to pressing the up button, detected by the predicate `pressUp(e)`.
- The `always guarantee` section defines the actions based on the button press:
  1. When the up button is pressed (`pressUp(e)`), the `count` variable is incremented by 1 every frame.
  2. When the up button is not pressed (`!pressUp(e)`), the `count` is reset to 0.5.
  3. Regardless of the button state, the cube's scale along the x-axis (`cube.scale.x`) is always set to the current `count` value.
