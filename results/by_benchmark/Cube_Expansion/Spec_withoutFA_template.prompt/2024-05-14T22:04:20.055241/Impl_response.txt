To implement the `pressUp(e)` predicate in JavaScript, we need to attach an event listener to the `window` object that listens for `keydown` events and checks if the key pressed is the up arrow key. Hereâ€™s how you can do this:

```javascript
// To store the state of the up arrow key
let isUpKeyPressed = false;

// Add event listeners to track when the up arrow key is pressed and released
window.addEventListener('keydown', function(e) {
    if (e.key === 'ArrowUp') {
        isUpKeyPressed = true;
    }
});

window.addEventListener('keyup', function(e) {
    if (e.key === 'ArrowUp') {
        isUpKeyPressed = false;
    }
});

// Predicate function to check if the up arrow key is pressed
function pressUp() {
    return isUpKeyPressed;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **State Variable (`isUpKeyPressed`)**: This boolean variable keeps track of whether the up arrow key is currently pressed. It is initially set to `false`.

2. **Event Listener for `keydown`**: The `keydown` event is triggered whenever any key is pressed down. Inside this event listener, we check if the key pressed (`e.key`) is `'ArrowUp'`. If it is, we set `isUpKeyPressed` to `true`.

3. **Event Listener for `keyup`**: Similarly, the `keyup` event is triggered when any key is released. We again check if the released key is the up arrow key. If it is, we reset `isUpKeyPressed` to `false`.

4. **Predicate Function `pressUp()`**: This function simply returns the current value of `isUpKeyPressed`. It returns `true` if the up arrow key is pressed, otherwise it returns `false`.

This setup allows you to use the `pressUp()` function within your application to check if the up arrow key is currently being pressed, adhering to the requirements of being a predicate.
