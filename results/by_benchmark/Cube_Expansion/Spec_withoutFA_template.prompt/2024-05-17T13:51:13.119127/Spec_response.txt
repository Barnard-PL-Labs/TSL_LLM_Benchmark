Here is the TSL specification for the scenario you described about a cube's scale reacting to the pressing of an up key:

```tsl
always assume {
}

always guarantee {
    // When the user presses the up key, increment the counter each frame
    pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

    // When the user is not pressing the up key, reset the counter to 0.5
    !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];

    // Update the cube's scale along the x-axis with the value of the counter
    [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

In this specification:

1. The `pressUp(e)` predicate checks if the up key is pressed. When it is true, the counter (`count`) increments by 1 every frame.
2. When `pressUp(e)` is false (i.e., the up key is not pressed), the counter resets to 0.5.
3. The scale of the cube along the x-axis (`cube.scale.x`) is continuously set to the current value of `count`.
