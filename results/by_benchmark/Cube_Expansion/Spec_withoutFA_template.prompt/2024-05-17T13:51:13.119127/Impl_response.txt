To implement the predicates as specified, we'll use JavaScript's event handling to create a function that checks if the up arrow key is being pressed. Since we are dealing with predicates, which should return a boolean value, and the environment interacts with cube scaling which is not directly relevant for our predicate, we will focus solely on the key press detection.

Here is how you can write a predicate function in JavaScript to check if the up arrow key is pressed:

```javascript
// Create a variable to keep track of the state of the up arrow key
let isUpKeyPressed = false;

// Add an event listener to the window to listen for keydown events
window.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
  // Check if the key pressed is the up arrow key (key code 38)
  if (event.keyCode === 38) {
    isUpKeyPressed = true;
  }
});

// Add an event listener to the window to listen for keyup events
window.addEventListener('keyup', function(event) {
  // Check if the key released is the up arrow key
  if (event.keyCode === 38) {
    isUpKeyPressed = false;
  }
});

// Predicate function to check if the up arrow key is pressed
function pressUp() {
  return isUpKeyPressed;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **State Tracking**: The `isUpKeyPressed` boolean variable is used to track whether the up key is currently pressed. It starts as `false` indicating that the key is not pressed initially.

2. **Event Listeners**: Two event listeners are added to the `window` object:
    - **keydown**: This event triggers when any key is pressed down. Inside this event, there is a check to see if the key code corresponds to the up arrow key (which has a keycode of 38). If it is, `isUpKeyPressed` is set to `true`.
    - **keyup**: This event triggers when any key is released. It similarly checks if the released key is the up arrow key and sets `isUpKeyPressed` to `false` if it is.

3. **Predicate Function**: The `pressUp()` function is a simple predicate that returns the current state of `isUpKeyPressed`, indicating if the up arrow key is currently pressed (`true`) or not (`false`).

With this implementation, any part of your JavaScript application can call `pressUp()` to determine if the up arrow key is currently being pressed, which can be useful for handling real-time interactions in web applications or games.
