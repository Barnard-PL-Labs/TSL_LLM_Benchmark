Here is the TSL specification for the described behavior of the cube reacting to the user pressing the up key, with scale adjustments:

```tsl
always assume {
  // No specific environmental assumptions required for this scenario
}

always guarantee {
  // If the up button is pressed, increment the counter each frame
  pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];
  
  // If the up button is not pressed, reset the counter to 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];
  
  // Update the scale value of the cube along the x-axis with the value of count
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Assumptions**: There are no specific environmental assumptions required in this scenario, as the behavior is purely reactive to the input and does not depend on other conditions.

2. **Guarantee Part 1**: When the up button is pressed (`pressUp(e)` is true), the counter `count` is incremented by 1 each frame. This is modelled by updating the `count` state with `count + 1`.

3. **Guarantee Part 2**: When the up button is not pressed (`pressUp(e)` is false), the counter `count` is reset to 0.5 immediately.

4. **Guarantee Part 3**: Independently of the up button being pressed or not, the cube's scale along the x-axis (`cube.scale.x`) is continuously updated to mirror the value of `count`. This ensures that the cube's scale responds dynamically to the changes in `count`.
