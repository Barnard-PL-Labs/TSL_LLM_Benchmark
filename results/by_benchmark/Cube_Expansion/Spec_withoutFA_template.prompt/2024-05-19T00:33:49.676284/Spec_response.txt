To translate the natural language description into a TSL specification, we will define the behavior for the cube's scale along the x-axis in response to user input from the up key. We need to handle the incrementing of a counter while the up key is pressed and reset the scale when the key is released. Here's the TSL code:

```tsl
always assume {
  // No specific environmental assumptions are mentioned.
}

always guarantee {
  // When the up button is not pressed, the cube's scale.x should be 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- 0.5];
  
  // When the up button is pressed, increment a counter each frame
  pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

  // Update cube.scale.x with the current value of count when the up key is pressed
  pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- count];

  // When the up button is released, the cube's scale.x should return to 0.5 and reset count to 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];
}
```

Explanation:
1. A `pressUp(e)` predicate checks if the up arrow key is pressed. If it is not pressed, `cube.scale.x` is set to 0.5.
2. When `pressUp(e)` is true (the up key is pressed), the counter `count` is incremented by 1 every frame.
3. The cube's scale value along the x-axis (`cube.scale.x`) is continuously updated to match the value of `count` while the up key is pressed.
4. When the up key is released, both `cube.scale.x` and `count` are reset to 0.5 to reflect the initial state.
