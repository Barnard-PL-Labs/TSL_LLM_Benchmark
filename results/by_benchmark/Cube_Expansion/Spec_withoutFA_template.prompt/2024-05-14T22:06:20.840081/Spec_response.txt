Here's how you can translate the given natural language description into a TSL specification:

```tsl
always assume {
  // This section would typically capture conditions or constraints from external inputs
  // that this specification depends on, but none specific are mentioned other than pressUp(e).
}

always guarantee {
  // When the up button is pressed, increment a counter each frame
  pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

  // When the up button is not pressed, reset the counter to 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];

  // Update the cube's scale x with the current value of the counter
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions**: The `always assume` block is empty because there are no environmental conditions or complex interactions specified that affect the truth of the guarantees. The behavior is solely based on the user's action of pressing the up key.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - When the user presses the up key (`pressUp(e)`), the counter (`count`) is incremented by 1 every frame. This is modeled by the update `[count <- count + 1]`.
   - When the up key is not pressed (`!pressUp(e)`), the counter is set to 0.5, ensuring the cube's scale resets. This is done using `[count <- 0.5]`.
   - Independently of the key press state, the scale of the cube along the x-axis is continuously updated to match the value of `count` using `[cube.scale.x <- count]`.

This TSL specification allows the cube's scale along the x-axis to dynamically react to user input, growing incrementally while the up key is held down and resetting when the key is released.
