To create a predicate in JavaScript that checks if the user presses the up arrow key using an event listener, follow the steps below. This will involve setting up an event listener for the keydown event and determining if the up arrow key is pressed. Since functions are not to be used and the system already has a defined API for setting cube properties, we'll focus exclusively on the predicate implementation.

### Step-by-step Predicate Implementation

1. **Define a Variable for Key State:**
   We'll define a boolean variable that keeps track of whether the up arrow key is pressed.

2. **Set Up Event Listeners:**
   We will set up event listeners for 'keydown' and 'keyup' to update this boolean variable accordingly.

3. **Predicate Logic:**
   The predicate will check the state of the boolean variable to determine if the up key is currently pressed.

Here is how you can implement it:

```javascript
// Variable to track the state of the up arrow key
let isUpKeyPressed = false;

// Event listener for 'keydown'
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
    if (event.key === "ArrowUp") {
        isUpKeyPressed = true;
    }
});

// Event listener for 'keyup'
document.addEventListener('keyup', function(event) {
    if (event.key === "ArrowUp") {
        isUpKeyPressed = false;
    }
});

// Predicate to check if the up arrow key is pressed
function pressUp() {
    return isUpKeyPressed;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Event Listeners:** The `keydown` event listener sets `isUpKeyPressed` to `true` when the up arrow key is pressed, and the `keyup` event resets it to `false` when the key is released. This ensures that `isUpKeyPressed` accurately reflects the current state of the up arrow key.
  
- **Predicate Function `pressUp`:** This function simply returns the value of `isUpKeyPressed`. When the up arrow key is pressed, it returns `true`, and when it's not, it returns `false`.

### Integration with System API

Since the JavaScript code above handles the detection of the up arrow key being pressed through the `pressUp` predicate, it can be used wherever needed in your system to check this condition. You can use this predicate to trigger changes or check conditions related to the system's behavior when the up arrow key is pressed.

This setup ensures minimal interference with other parts of your system and maintains a clear separation of concerns, with `pressUp` dedicated solely to the task of determining the state of the up arrow key.
