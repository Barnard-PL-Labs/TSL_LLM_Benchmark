Here's how you might write this specification in TSL:

```tsl
always assume {
  // No explicit assumptions stated; add relevant assumptions here if necessary
}

always guarantee {
  // If the up button is not pressed, the counter remains at 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];

  // When the up button is pressed, increment the count by 1 every frame
  pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

  // The scale of the cube along the x-axis follows the value of the counter
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

This specification addresses the natural language requirements by setting up a counter that increments when the up key is pressed and remains constant when the up key is not pressed. The scale of the cube along the x-axis is bound to the value of this counter, ensuring that the cube reacts appropriately to user input per the described behavior.
