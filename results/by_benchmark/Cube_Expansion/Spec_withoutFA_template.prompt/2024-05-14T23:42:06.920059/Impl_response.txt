Since predicates in your description return a boolean and must be implemented in JavaScript with event listeners for keyboard input, we can use the browser's `addEventListener` to listen for key presses. Below is an implementation for the predicate `pressUp(e)` that checks if the up arrow key is pressed:

```javascript
// This variable will keep track of whether the 'Up' arrow key is currently being pressed
let isUpKeyPressed = false;

// Function to call when a key is pressed
function handleKeyDown(event) {
    // Check if the key pressed is the 'Up' arrow key
    if (event.keyCode === 38) {
        isUpKeyPressed = true;
    }
}

// Function to call when a key is released
function handleKeyUp(event) {
    // Check if the key released is the 'Up' arrow key
    if (event.keyCode === 38) {
        isUpKeyPressed = false;
    }
}

// Adding event listeners to the document to listen for keydown and keyup events
document.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
document.addEventListener('keyup', handleKeyUp);

// Predicate function to check if the 'Up' arrow key is pressed
function pressUp() {
    return isUpKeyPressed;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Variable Definition**: `isUpKeyPressed` is a boolean variable that stores the state of the 'Up' arrow key (whether it is being pressed or not).

2. **Event Handlers**:
   - `handleKeyDown`: This function sets `isUpKeyPressed` to `true` if the 'Up' arrow key (key code 38) is pressed.
   - `handleKeyUp`: This function sets `isUpKeyPressed` to `false` when the 'Up' arrow key is released.

3. **Event Listeners**: The document listens for `keydown` and `keyup` events which are handled by `handleKeyDown` and `handleKeyUp` respectively.

4. **Predicate Function**: `pressUp()` simply returns the current value of `isUpKeyPressed`, indicating whether the 'Up' arrow is currently pressed.

This implementation provides a way to check the state of the 'Up' arrow key at any moment by calling `pressUp()`. This predicate can be used in any system that needs to respond to this particular key event.
