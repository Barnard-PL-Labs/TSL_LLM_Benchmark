Here is the TSL specification based on your description:

```TSL
always assume {
  // no specific assumptions about the environment
}

always guarantee {
  // when the up key is not pressed, the counter is reset to 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];

  // when the up key is pressed, increment the counter by 1 every frame
  pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

  // the scale of the cube along the x-axis always equals the count
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```
