Here is how you can translate the provided natural language description into a TSL specification:

```tsl
always assume {
  // No assumptions specified for external behavior or interactions outside of the up key usage.
}

always guarantee {
  // If the up key is not pressed, reset the counter and cube's scale x to 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> ([count <- 0.5] && [cube.scale.x <- 0.5]);

  // When the up button is pressed, increment the counter by 1 every frame
  // and update the cube's scale x to match the counter
  pressUp(e) -> (X ([count <- count + 1] && [cube.scale.x <- count]));
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions**: There are no specific assumptions about the environment or other interactions that need to be handled, as the description mainly focuses on the interaction with the up key.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - If the up key is not pressed (`!pressUp(e)`), this guarantee ensures that the counter is reset to 0.5 and the cube's scale along the x-axis is also set to 0.5. This matches the description where it states the scale should return to 0.5 when the key is not pressed.
   - When the up key is pressed (`pressUp(e)`), the value of the counter is incremented by 1 in the next frame (`X ([count <- count + 1])`), and the cube's scale along the x-axis is updated to match the counter value (`[cube.scale.x <- count]`). This increment continues for every frame as long as the up key remains pressed, reflecting the iterative scale increase described.
