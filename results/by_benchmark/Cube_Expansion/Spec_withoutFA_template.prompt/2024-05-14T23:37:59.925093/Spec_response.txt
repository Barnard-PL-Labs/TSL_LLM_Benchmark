Here's the TSL specification based on the description provided:

```tsl
always assume{
    // No specific assumptions given about external inputs or conditions
}

always guarantee{
    // When the up button is not pressed, reset the counter to 0.5
    !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];

    // When the up button is pressed, increment the counter by 1 each frame
    pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

    // The cube's x-axis scale is always updated to match the current counter value
    [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```
