Below is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description and the requirements:

```
always assume {
  // Include any necessary assumptions here if there were additional interactions, not needed for this simple case.
}

always guarantee {
  // When the user presses the up button, increment the count by 1 every frame and update cube.scale.x accordingly
  pressUp(e) -> ([count <- count + 1] && [cube.scale.x <- count]);
  
  // When the user is not pressing the up button, reset the count to 0.5 and set cube.scale.x to 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> ([count <- 0.5] && [cube.scale.x <- 0.5]);
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions**: For this specific scenario, there are no external dependencies or complex interactions that require assumptions to be explicitly defined.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - **While the up key is pressed**: The specification indicates that `count` should increment by 1 every frame when the up button is pressed, and the `cube.scale.x` should update to reflect the current value of `count`. This is achieved using the `[count <- count + 1]` operation combined with `[cube.scale.x <- count]`.
   - **While the up key is not pressed**: It specifies that both `count` should reset to 0.5 and `cube.scale.x` should also be set to 0.5, ensuring that the cube returns to its original scale along the x-axis when the key is not being pressed. This reset is handled by `[count <- 0.5]` and `[cube.scale.x <- 0.5]`.

This TSL code effectively describes the interaction of scaling a cube on the x-axis in response to user input from the up arrow key, with real-time updates and resets.
