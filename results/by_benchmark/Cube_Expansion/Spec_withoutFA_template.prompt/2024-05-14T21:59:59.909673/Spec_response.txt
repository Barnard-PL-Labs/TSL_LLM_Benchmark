Here's the TSL specification based on your description:

```tsl
always assume{
  // No specific environmental assumptions defined here.
}

always guarantee{
  // Initialize the scale of the cube along the x-axis to 0.5 when not pressing the up button
  !pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- 0.5];

  // When the up button is pressed, increment the value of count each frame
  pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

  // When the up button is not pressed, reset count to 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];

  // Update the cube's scale along the x-axis with the value of count
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Assumptions**: I have not defined any specific assumptions in this section, as the environment's behavior does not impose particular conditions that affect the logic specified in your request.

- **Guarantees**:
  1. When the user is not pressing the up button, the scale of the cube along the x-axis is set to 0.5.
  2. If the up button is pressed, a counter named `count` is incremented by 1 in each frame to track how long the button is held down.
  3. When the up button is not being pressed, the counter `count` is reset to 0.5 to signify no pressure being applied.
  4. The scale of the cube along the x-axis (`cube.scale.x`) is continuously updated to match the value of `count`, reflecting changes in scale based on the duration the up button is pressed.

This specification assumes there is a mechanism (`count`) to track the duration of the button press, which directly influences the scale of the cube in the x-axis.
