Below is the TSL specification based on the given natural language description. The assumptions and guarantees are crafted to reflect the behavior of the cube's scale and the interaction with the up key press.

```tsl
always assume {
  // No specific environmental assumptions needed beyond the predicates
}

always guarantee {
  // When the up button is not pressed, the counter remains at 0.5 and so does the cube's scale
  !pressUp(e) -> ([count <- 0.5] && [cube.scale.x <- 0.5]);

  // When the up button is pressed, increment the counter by 1 every frame and update the cube's scale
  pressUp(e) -> (X [count <- count + 1] && X [cube.scale.x <- count]);
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions**: There are no special assumptions about the environment stated. The behavior is entirely dictated by user input (pressing the up key).

2. **Guarantees**:
   - If the up key is not being pressed (`!pressUp(e)`), the counter is set to 0.5, and the cube's scale along the x-axis is also set to the same value 0.5. This is ensured by the guarantee `[count <- 0.5] && [cube.scale.x <- 0.5]`.
   - If the up key is pressed (`pressUp(e)`), two actions are guaranteed at the next state (`X`): the counter (`count`) is incremented by 1, and the cube's scale along the x-axis (`cube.scale.x`) is updated to this new value of the counter. This ensures that the scale grows incrementally as long as the up key is held down.
