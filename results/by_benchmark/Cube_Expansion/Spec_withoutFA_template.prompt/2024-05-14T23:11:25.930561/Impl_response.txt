To implement the predicate `pressUp(e)` in JavaScript, which checks if the user presses the up arrow key on their keyboard, we can use an event listener that listens for the "keydown" event. This predicate will be true when the up key is pressed and false otherwise.

Given that we are not implementing any functions, and only predicates, here is how you can set up the `pressUp(e)` predicate using JavaScript:

```javascript
// Variable to store the state of the up arrow key
let upKeyPressed = false;

// Adding an event listener to the document to listen for keydown events
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(e) {
    // Check if the key pressed is the up arrow key (key code 38)
    if (e.keyCode === 38) {
        upKeyPressed = true;
    }
});

// Adding an event listener to the document to listen for keyup events
document.addEventListener('keyup', function(e) {
    // Reset the upKeyPressed when the up arrow key is released
    if (e.keyCode === 38) {
        upKeyPressed = false;
    }
});

// Predicate function to check if the up arrow key is currently pressed
function pressUp() {
    return upKeyPressed;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Global State Variable**: A variable `upKeyPressed` is used to hold the state of whether the up arrow key is pressed or not. It is initialized to `false`.

2. **Keydown Event Listener**: An event listener is added to the entire document to listen for "keydown" events. When the up arrow key (which has the keycode 38) is pressed, the `upKeyPressed` variable is set to `true`.

3. **Keyup Event Listener**: Another event listener is added to reset the `upKeyPressed` variable when the up arrow key is released. It listens for "keyup" events and sets `upKeyPressed` to `false` when the up arrow key is released.

4. **Predicate Function `pressUp`**: This function simply returns the current state of the `upKeyPressed` variable, indicating whether the up arrow key is currently pressed (`true`) or not (`false`).

This setup ensures that at any point, the `pressUp()` function will provide the correct boolean value depending on whether the up arrow key is actively being pressed.
