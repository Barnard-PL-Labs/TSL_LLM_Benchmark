Here is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description:

```tsl
always assume {
    // No specific assumptions needed about the environment for this specification
}

always guarantee {
    // When the up button is pressed, increment the counter each frame
    pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];
    
    // When the up button is not pressed, reset the counter to 0.5
    !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];
    
    // The scale value of the cube along the x-axis is updated according to the value of the counter
    [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

Explanation:
- The `always assume` block is left empty as there are no specific assumptions about the environment or interactions other than the pressing of the up key, which is handled in the guarantees section.
- The `always guarantee` block handles the logic of pressing the up key to increment a counter and resetting the counter when the key is not pressed.
- It also ensures that the scale of the cube along the x-axis (`cube.scale.x`) is continuously updated to reflect the value of the counter (`count`), which changes based on the user's interaction with the up key.
