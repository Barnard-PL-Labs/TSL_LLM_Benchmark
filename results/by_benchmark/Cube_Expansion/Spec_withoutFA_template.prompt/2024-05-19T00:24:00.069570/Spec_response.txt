Here is a TSL specification that models the behavior described in the natural language description. It focuses on updating the cube's x-axis scale in response to the user pressing the up key, using a counter to track the duration of the press:

```tsl
always assume {
  // No specific environmental assumptions are required for this setup.
}

always guarantee {
  // Initialize the counter and scale when the up key is not pressed.
  !pressUp(e) -> ([count <- 0.5] && [cube.scale.x <- 0.5]);
  
  // When the up key is pressed, increment the counter by 1 every frame and update the cube's scale.
  pressUp(e) -> (X [count <- count + 1] && [cube.scale.x <- count]);
  
  // When the up key is released, reset the counter to 0.5 and update the cube's scale back to 0.5.
  !pressUp(e) -> ([count <- 0.5] && [cube.scale.x <- 0.5]);
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Initial State**: When the up key (`pressUp(e)`) is not pressed, we set the `count` to `0.5` and the `cube.scale.x` to `0.5`. This initializes the cube's scale along the x-axis to a default value.

2. **Key Pressed**: Upon pressing the up key, the `count` variable increments by 1 each frame. This increment reflects continuous pressing of the key. The cube's scale (`cube.scale.x`) is then updated to the current value of `count`.

3. **Key Released**: When the up key is released, the counter and the cube's scale are reset to `0.5`, hence returning to the initial state and scale.

This setup ensures that the cube's scale along the x-axis reacts dynamically to user input, growing incrementally with continuous press and resetting upon release.
