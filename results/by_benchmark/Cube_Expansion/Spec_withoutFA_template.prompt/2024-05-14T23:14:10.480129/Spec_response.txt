Here is the TSL specification based on your description:

```TSL
always assume {
  // No specific assumptions are required for this scenario
}

always guarantee {
  // When the user presses the up button, increment the counter (count) continuously
  pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

  // When the user is not pressing the up button, reset the counter to 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];

  // The cube's scale along the x-axis is always updated to the value of the counter
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

In this specification:
- The `pressUp(e)` predicate is used to detect when the up arrow key is pressed.
- The value of `count` is incremented each frame while the up key is pressed, simulating continuous scale change.
- When the up key is not pressed, the value of `count` is reset to 0.5, which in turn sets the cube's scale along the x-axis back to 0.5.
- The cube's scale along the x-axis (`cube.scale.x`) is updated every frame to reflect the value of `count`, ensuring that changes in scale due to key presses are reflected visually in real-time.
