To achieve the creation of the `pressUp(e)` predicate using JavaScript, we need to set up an event listener that listens for keyboard events and determines whether the 'up arrow' key is pressed. Since we are not actually implementing functions but providing the logic for predicates, I will showcase how you might set up such an event listener and maintain a boolean state that represents whether the 'up arrow' key is currently pressed. This will effectively act as our predicate.

Here is a JavaScript example that implements the predicate logic:

```javascript
// Setting up a variable to track the state of the up arrow key
let isUpArrowPressed = false;

// Function to handle the 'keydown' event
function handleKeyDown(event) {
    if (event.key === "ArrowUp") {
        isUpArrowPressed = true;
    }
}

// Function to handle the 'keyup' event
function handleKeyUp(event) {
    if (event.key === "ArrowUp") {
        isUpArrowPressed = false;
    }
}

// Adding event listeners to the document
document.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
document.addEventListener('keyup', handleKeyUp);

// Predicate to check if the up arrow key is pressed
function pressUp() {
    return isUpArrowPressed;
}

// Usage of the predicate
if (pressUp()) {
    console.log("The Up Arrow key is currently pressed.");
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **State Variable**: `isUpArrowPressed` is a boolean variable that tracks whether the 'up arrow' key is pressed. It is initially set to false.

2. **Event Handlers**: `handleKeyDown` and `handleKeyUp` are functions that update `isUpArrowPressed`. `handleKeyDown` sets it to true when the 'up arrow' key is pressed, and `handleKeyUp` sets it back to false when the 'up arrow' key is released.

3. **Event Listeners**: These are attached to the `document` object to listen for 'keydown' and 'keyup' events. They ensure that any key press or release is detected, allowing for real-time updates of the predicate state.

4. **Predicate Function**: `pressUp()` is a function that acts as a predicate, returning the current state of `isUpArrowPressed`. This function can be called to check if the 'up arrow' key is currently pressed.

This setup ensures that the system can always check the state of the 'up arrow' key by calling `pressUp()`. The integration of real-time key event tracking makes the predicate responsive and accurate according to user input.
