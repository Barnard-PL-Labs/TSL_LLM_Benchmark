A system environment has the following API. Using the API, implement the following methods in JavaScript. The methods are divided into two categories, "functions" and "predicates". "functions" can be arbitrary functions, but "predicates" always return a boolean.

In this case, don't use and implement any functions.

Predicates to implement:


Cells:
  Cube represents the state of the signal that determines the cube's scale along the x-axis.

Functions:

Predicates:
  pressUp(e) => Checks if the user presses the up arrow key on their keyboard. This requires adding an event listener in the function to listen for the keydown event. This predicate is true when the up key is pressed and false otherwise.

System API:


/*

Get or set the cube.scale.x in 3D by changing "cube.scale.x".

*/
