To implement the predicate `pressUp(e)` in JavaScript, which checks if the user has pressed the up arrow key on their keyboard, you will need to use the `addEventListener` method on the `document` object to listen for `keydown` and `keyup` events. Since the predicates should return a boolean indicating whether the up arrow key is pressed or not, we'll manage this state with a variable.

Here is how you can set it up:

```javascript
let isUpKeyPressed = false;

// Event listener for keydown
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
    if (event.key === 'ArrowUp') {
        isUpKeyPressed = true;
    }
});

// Event listener for keyup
document.addEventListener('keyup', function(event) {
    if (event.key === 'ArrowUp') {
        isUpKeyPressed = false;
    }
});

// Predicate function to check if the up arrow key is pressed
function pressUp() {
    return isUpKeyPressed;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **State Variable (`isUpKeyPressed`)**: This variable holds the state of the up arrow key, whether it's currently pressed (`true`) or not (`false`).

2. **Event Listeners**: 
   - The `keydown` event listener sets `isUpKeyPressed` to `true` if the up arrow key (`ArrowUp`) is pressed.
   - The `keyup` event listener sets `isUpKeyPressed` back to `false` when the up arrow key is released.

3. **Predicate Function (`pressUp`)**: This function simply returns the current state of `isUpKeyPressed`, indicating whether the up arrow key is currently pressed.

This setup ensures that the system can accurately and dynamically check the state of the up arrow key at any time by calling the `pressUp()` function, as required by a predicate in TSL (Temporal Stream Logic) specifications.
