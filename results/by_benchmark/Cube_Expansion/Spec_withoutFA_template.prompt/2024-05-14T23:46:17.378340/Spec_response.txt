Here's the TSL specification based on the provided description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // There are no specific environmental assumptions provided
}

always guarantee {
  // Counter increment logic when the up key is pressed
  pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

  // Reset counter when the up key is not pressed
  !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];

  // Update the cube's scale along the x-axis with the value of the counter
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

In this TSL specification:

- We define no specific assumptions since the environment's conditions are not explicitly defined.
- The `always guarantee` contains the rules:
  1. When the `pressUp(e)` is true (i.e., the up key is pressed), the counter `count` is incremented by 1 every frame.
  2. When the `pressUp(e)` predicate is false (i.e., the up key is not pressed), the counter `count` resets to 0.5.
  3. The scale of the cube along the x-axis (`cube.scale.x`) is always updated to the current value of `count`.
