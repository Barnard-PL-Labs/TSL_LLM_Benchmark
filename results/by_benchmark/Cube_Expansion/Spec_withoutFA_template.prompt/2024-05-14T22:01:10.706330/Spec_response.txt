Here's the TSL specification based on your description of the cube's behavior in response to pressing the up arrow key:

```tsl
always assume {
    // No specific assumptions beyond basic input handling which is implied
}

always guarantee {
    // When the up key is pressed, increment the counter every frame
    pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];
    
    // When the up key is not pressed, the counter should be reset to 0.5
    !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];
    
    // The cube's scale along the x-axis follows the value of the counter
    [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions:** There are no explicit assumptions specified about the environment or other conditions, as the behavior is directly tied to the user's interaction (pressing the up key).

2. **Guarantees:**
   - **Incrementing Counter:** When the up key (`pressUp(e)`) is held down, the `count` variable is incremented by 1 for each frame this condition remains true.
   - **Resetting Counter:** Whenever the up key is not being pressed (`!pressUp(e)`), the `count` is set to 0.5. This ensures that the scale returns to its initial size when the key is released.
   - **Updating Cube Scale:** Independently of the input state, the `cube.scale.x` is always set to the current value of `count`, ensuring the cube's scale is correctly updated in real-time to reflect user input.
