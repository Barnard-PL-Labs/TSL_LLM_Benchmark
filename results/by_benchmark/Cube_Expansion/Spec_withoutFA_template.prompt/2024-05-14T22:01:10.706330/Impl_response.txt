To implement a predicate `pressUp(e)` that checks if the user presses the up arrow key on their keyboard, we can make use of JavaScript's `addEventListener` function to listen for the `keydown` event. Since predicates in this context must return a boolean indicating the truth of a condition (in this case, whether the up arrow key is pressed), we'll need to maintain the state of this condition.

Below is an example of how you can implement this in JavaScript without using the system's API for setting `cube.scale.x`, as no function implementations are required according to your instructions.

```javascript
// Define a variable to keep track of the up arrow key state
let isUpKeyPressed = false;

// Add event listeners to update the state
window.addEventListener('keydown', function(e) {
    if (e.key === "ArrowUp") {
        isUpKeyPressed = true;
    }
});

window.addEventListener('keyup', function(e) {
    if (e.key === "ArrowUp") {
        isUpKeyPressed = false;
    }
});

// Predicate function to check if the up arrow key is pressed
function pressUp() {
    return isUpKeyPressed;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **State Variable (`isUpKeyPressed`)**: This variable maintains whether the up arrow key is currently pressed. It starts as `false`.

2. **Event Listeners**: 
   - The `keydown` event listener sets `isUpKeyPressed` to `true` when the up arrow key is detected.
   - The `keyup` event listener resets `isUpKeyPressed` to `false` when the up arrow key is released.

3. **Predicate (`pressUp`)**: This function returns the current state of `isUpKeyPressed`, effectively indicating whether the up arrow key is currently pressed (`true`) or not (`false`).

This implementation fulfills the requirement of the predicate to dynamically check the state of the up arrow key press and can be used within any JavaScript environment that supports event handling, such as web browsers. Note that this setup doesn't include any use of the `cube.scale.x` as it wasn't required for the predicates you asked to be implemented.
