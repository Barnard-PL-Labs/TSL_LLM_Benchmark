Here is how you can translate the provided natural language description into a TSL (Temporal Stream Logic) specification:

```tsl
always assume{
    // There are no specific environmental assumptions mentioned for this scenario.
}

always guarantee{
    // When the up key is pressed, increment a counter each frame.
    pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

    // When the up key is not pressed, reset the counter to 0.5.
    !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];

    // The cube's scale along the x-axis follows the value of the counter.
    [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions**: There are no specific assumptions about the environment mentioned in the description, so the `always assume` block is left empty.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - **Incremental Count**: When the user presses the up key (indicated by `pressUp(e)`), a counter variable (`count`) is incremented by 1 every frame. This is specified by the rule `pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];`.
   - **Reset Counter**: When the up key is not pressed, the counter is reset to 0.5. This is done using the negation of the `pressUp(e)` predicate, i.e., `!pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];`.
   - **Cube Scale Update**: The scale of the cube along the x-axis (`cube.scale.x`) is continuously set to mirror the value of `count`. This ensures that the cube's scale is updated based on user interaction or reset to 0.5 when there is no interaction.

This TSL specification captures the reactive behavior of the cube's scale in response to the up key press as described in the natural language input.
