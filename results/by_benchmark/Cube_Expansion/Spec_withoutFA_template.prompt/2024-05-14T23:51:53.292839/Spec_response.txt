Here is a TSL specification based on the given description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Define the behavior of the input, which is the pressing of the up key.
}

always guarantee {
  // When the up key is not pressed, reset the scale and count to 0.5.
  !pressUp(e) -> ([cube.scale.x <- 0.5] && [count <- 0.5]);

  // When the up key is pressed, increment the counter each frame and update the scale of the cube accordingly.
  pressUp(e) -> (X [count <- count + 1] && [cube.scale.x <- count]);
}
```

### Explanation:

**Assumptions:**
- The specification assumes that the behavior of the `pressUp(e)` predicate is managed outside of the TSL scope, as indicated by the empty assumption block. This predicate reacts to user input that is defined elsewhere, likely in a hardware or software listener setup.

**Guarantees:**
1. **Handling the up key not being pressed (`!pressUp(e)`):**
   - The cube's x-axis scale (`cube.scale.x`) is reset to 0.5.
   - The counter (`count`) used to track continuous pressing is also reset to 0.5.
   - This ensures that whenever the up key is not pressed, both the scale and the counter are at their initial state.

2. **Handling the up key being pressed (`pressUp(e)`):**
   - The next state (`X`) of the counter (`count`) is set to increment by 1 from its current value.
   - Simultaneously, the cube's x-axis scale (`cube.scale.x`) is updated to match the current value of the counter.
   - This setup allows the scale to increment continuously as long as the up key is held down, simulating a dynamic response to sustained user input.

This specification fits the behavior described, where the cube's scale reacts dynamically and incrementally to the pressing of the up key, with a reset behavior when the key is not pressed.
