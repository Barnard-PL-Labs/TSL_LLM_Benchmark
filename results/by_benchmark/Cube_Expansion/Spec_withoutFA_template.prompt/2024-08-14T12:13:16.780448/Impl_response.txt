To implement the described program in JavaScript, we need to handle the asynchronous nature of keyboard events and update the cube's scale dynamically based on the user's input. We'll use an event listener for the 'keydown' and 'keyup' events to detect when the up key is pressed and released. We'll also need to implement a mechanism to increment the scale value while the key is held down, and reset it when the key is released.

Here's a JavaScript implementation:

```javascript
// Define the initial state and variables
let cube = {
  scale: {
    x: 0.5
  }
};
let isUpKeyPressed = false;
let count = 0.5;

// Event listeners for keydown and keyup events
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
  if (event.key === 'ArrowUp') {
    isUpKeyPressed = true;
  }
});

document.addEventListener('keyup', function(event) {
  if (event.key === 'ArrowUp') {
    isUpKeyPressed = false;
    count = 0.5;  // Reset count when the key is released
    cube.scale.x = count;  // Update the scale immediately when the key is released
  }
});

// Function to update state
function updateState() {
  if (isUpKeyPressed) {
    count += 1;  // Increment the count each frame when the up key is pressed
    cube.scale.x = count;  // Update the cube's scale
  }
  
  // Return the current state
  return {
    cube,
    count
  };
}

// Animation frame to simulate the 'frame' concept where updateState is called periodically
function animate() {
  updateState();  // Update the state based on the current input
  console.log(`Cube scale x: ${cube.scale.x}, Count: ${count}`);  // Log the current scale and count for debugging
  requestAnimationFrame(animate);  // Continue the animation
}

// Start the animation
animate();
```

### Explanation
1. **Event Listeners**: We set up event listeners for 'keydown' and 'keyup' events to detect when the up arrow key is pressed and released. The state variable `isUpKeyPressed` is used to track whether the up key is currently being pressed.

2. **State and Update Function**: The `updateState` function adjusts the cube's scale based on whether the up key is pressed. It increments the `count` by 1 for each frame the key is held down, updating `cube.scale.x` accordingly. When the up key is released, `count` is reset to 0.5, and the cube's scale is immediately updated.

3. **Animation**: The `animate` function simulates continuous frame updates using `requestAnimationFrame`, calling `updateState` to handle the logic for each frame. This function also logs the current scale and count to the console for debugging and visualization purposes.

This script effectively handles the cube's scale adjustment in response to the up key press, as specified in the description.
