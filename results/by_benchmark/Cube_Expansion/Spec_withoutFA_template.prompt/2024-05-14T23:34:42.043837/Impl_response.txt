To implement the predicate `pressUp(e)` that checks if the user presses the up arrow key, you can use JavaScript to add an event listener to the window object. This listener will monitor for `keydown` events and will specifically check if the up arrow key (which has the key code 38) was pressed. The predicate will return `true` when the up key is pressed and `false` otherwise.

Below, I'll outline how you can set up the event listener and manage the state of the up arrow key press.

### JavaScript Implementation

```javascript
// Define a variable to keep track of the up arrow key state
let isUpKeyPressed = false;

// Add event listeners to the window to detect keydown and keyup events
window.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
    // Check if the key pressed is the up arrow key
    if (event.keyCode === 38) {
        isUpKeyPressed = true;
    }
});

window.addEventListener('keyup', function(event) {
    // Check if the key released is the up arrow key
    if (event.keyCode === 38) {
        isUpKeyPressed = false;
    }
});

// Function to check if the up arrow key is currently pressed
function pressUp() {
    return isUpKeyPressed;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Variable Declaration**: 
   - `isUpKeyPressed` is a boolean variable that tracks whether the up arrow key is currently pressed. It is initially set to `false`.

2. **Event Listeners**:
   - The `keydown` event listener checks if the key being pressed is the up arrow key (key code 38). If it is, `isUpKeyPressed` is set to `true`.
   - The `keyup` event listener does the opposite: it sets `isUpKeyPressed` back to `false` when the up arrow key is released.

3. **Predicate Function**:
   - The `pressUp()` function is a simple predicate that returns the current state of `isUpKeyPressed`. It returns `true` if the up arrow key is pressed, and `false` otherwise.

This setup allows you to use the `pressUp()` function anywhere in your code to check if the up key is currently pressed, adhering to the requirements of a predicate within the system environment.
