Based on the detailed description provided, here is how the Temporal Stream Logic (TSL) specification could be written to capture the behavior of a cube responding to user input to control its scale along the x-axis:

```tsl
always assume {
    // No specific environmental assumptions are needed for this scenario
}

always guarantee {
    // When the user presses the up button, increase the 'count' by 1 each frame
    pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];
    
    // When the user is not pressing the up button, set 'count' to 0.5
    !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];
    
    // Update the scale value of the cube along the x-axis with the current count
    [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Assumptions**: There are no specific predicates or conditions from the environment that affect the logic directly, so the `assume` block is empty.
- **Guarantees**:
  1. The `pressUp(e)` predicate checks if the up key is pressed. If it is true, the cube's related counter `count` will be incremented by 1 every frame the key is pressed.
  2. If the up key is not pressed (`!pressUp(e)`), the counter resets to 0.5.
  3. Independently of the keypress state, the cubeâ€™s x-axis scale (`cube.scale.x`) is set to the value of `count`. This ensures that the cube's scale is updated every frame based on the current value of `count`.
