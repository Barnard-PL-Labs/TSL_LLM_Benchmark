Here is the TSL specification based on the given description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // There are no specific environmental conditions to assume in this context
}

always guarantee {
  // If the up button is pressed, the counter increments by 1 every frame
  pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

  // If the up button is not pressed, the counter resets to 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];

  // The cube's scale along the x-axis is set to the value of the counter
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

This TSL specification captures the behavior of the cube's scaling in response to the user pressing the up key, with the scale being controlled by a counter that increments while the key is pressed and resets when it is not. The guarantee sections ensure the dynamic behavior of the cube's scale based on user input.
