Based on the detailed description and requirements provided, here's how the TSL specification can be structured for the scenario with the cube's scale and user interaction with the up key:

```tsl
always assume {
}

always guarantee {
    // Set default counter and scale values when the up button is not pressed
    !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5] && [cube.scale.x <- 0.5];

    // Increment counter by 1 every frame while the up button is pressed
    pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

    // Update cube scale to match the counter value
    pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Assumptions**: There are no specific assumptions about the environment or other conditions that must hold true all the time, which is why the `always assume` block is empty.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - When the `up` button is not being pressed (`!pressUp(e)`), the counter (`count`) is set to 0.5, and the `cube.scale.x` is also set to 0.5.
   - When the `up` button is pressed (`pressUp(e)`), the value of the counter (`count`) increments by 1 for every frame that the button remains pressed.
   - Concurrently, as long as the `up` button is pressed (`pressUp(e)`), the cube's scale along the x-axis (`cube.scale.x`) updates to the current value of `count`, effectively scaling the cube as the button is held down.

This TSL specification directly ties the cube's scaling behavior to the up button being pressed, with an immediate reset when the button is released.
