To implement the given predicate `pressUp(e)` in JavaScript with the provided system API, we need to create an event listener that will listen to the `keydown` event on the document and check if the pressed key is the up arrow key. Below, I provide the JavaScript code required to implement this functionality.

Since you mentioned using the system API, I will assume that the object `cube` is globally accessible. However, for the `pressUp(e)` predicate, we are not directly interacting with `cube` but simply detecting key presses. Here's how you can implement the predicate:

```javascript
// Initialize a variable to track the state of the up arrow key
let isUpKeyPressed = false;

// Function to be used as a predicate
function pressUp() {
  return isUpKeyPressed;
}

// Event listener for 'keydown' event to detect if the up arrow key is pressed
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(e) {
  if (e.key === 'ArrowUp') {
    isUpKeyPressed = true;
  }
});

// Event listener for 'keyup' event to reset the up arrow key state when it is released
document.addEventListener('keyup', function(e) {
  if (e.key === 'ArrowUp') {
    isUpKeyPressed = false;
  }
});
```

### Explanation:
1. **Variable Initialization**: `isUpKeyPressed` is a boolean variable initialized to `false`. It tracks whether the up arrow key is currently pressed.

2. **Predicate Function**: `pressUp()` returns the current state of `isUpKeyPressed`. It acts as a predicate to check if the up arrow key is pressed.

3. **Event Listeners**:
   - The `keydown` event listener sets `isUpKeyPressed` to `true` when the up arrow key is pressed.
   - The `keyup` event listener sets `isUpKeyPressed` to `false` when the up arrow key is released. This makes sure that the predicate reflects the real-time state of the key.

With this implementation, `pressUp()` can be used within your system to check if the up arrow key is currently being pressed. This helps in controlling flow or logic based on user input without directly interacting with the `cube` object or its properties.
