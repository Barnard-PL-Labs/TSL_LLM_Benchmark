To create a JavaScript implementation for the given requirements, we need to specify how the predicate `pressUp(e)` operates. This predicate will check if the up arrow key (typically represented by the key code `ArrowUp`) is pressed. Since the requirement specifies using an event listener for the `keydown` event, we'll set this up on the `document` object.

Here is how you can implement this in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Global variable to keep track of the up arrow key press state
let isUpKeyPressed = false;

// Function to update isUpKeyPressed when the up arrow key is pressed
function updateKeyPressState(event) {
    if (event.key === 'ArrowUp') {
        isUpKeyPressed = true;
    }
}

// Function to reset the isUpKeyPressed when the key is released
function resetKeyPressState(event) {
    if (event.key === 'ArrowUp') {
        isUpKeyPressed = false;
    }
}

// Adding event listeners to the document for keydown and keyup events
document.addEventListener('keydown', updateKeyPressState);
document.addEventListener('keyup', resetKeyPressState);

// Predicate function to check if the up key is pressed
function pressUp() {
    return isUpKeyPressed;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Global Variable (`isUpKeyPressed`)**: This variable holds the current state of the up arrow key, whether it's pressed or not. It starts as `false`.

2. **Function (`updateKeyPressState`)**: This function listens for `keydown` events. When an event occurs, it checks if the pressed key is the up arrow key (`ArrowUp`). If it is, it sets `isUpKeyPressed` to `true`.

3. **Function (`resetKeyPressState`)**: This listens for `keyup` events. It similarly checks if the released key is the up arrow and resets `isUpKeyPressed` to `false` when the key is released.

4. **Event Listeners**: These are set on the document to listen for `keydown` and `keyup` events. They trigger `updateKeyPressState` and `resetKeyPressState` respectively.

5. **Predicate Function (`pressUp`)**: This function returns the current state of the up arrow key by returning the value of `isUpKeyPressed`.

This setup ensures that the state of the up arrow key is accurately tracked and can be queried at any time using the `pressUp` predicate function.
