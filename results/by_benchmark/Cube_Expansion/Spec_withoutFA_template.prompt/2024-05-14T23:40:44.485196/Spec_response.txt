To translate the natural language description into a TSL specification, we first define the behavior of the cube's x-axis scaling in response to user inputs (pressing the up key). We will utilize a counter to handle the scale increments while the key is pressed, and reset the scale to 0.5 when the key is released.

Here's the TSL specification based on the provided description:

```tsl
always assume {
    // This space can include additional assumptions if needed in a more complex setup
}

always guarantee {
    // When the user is not pressing the up button, set the counter (count) to 0.5
    !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];
    
    // When the user presses the up button, increment the counter (count) by 1 each frame
    pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];
    
    // The scale value along the x-axis (cube.scale.x) is updated with the value of the counter (count)
    [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions block**: Here, you may add conditions related to the environment or user inputs not conflicting with each other, but in this case, it’s straightforward with only one input to manage.

2. **Guarantees block**:
   - The first guarantee ensures that when the up key is not pressed (`!pressUp(e)`), the counter `count` is set to 0.5.
   - The second guarantee covers the scenario when the up key is pressed (`pressUp(e)`), and it specifies that the counter `count` should increase by 1 every frame. This requires the system to track frames or time intervals.
   - The last line in the guarantees block directly sets the cube’s scale along the x-axis (`cube.scale.x`) to the current value of `count`, ensuring the cube's scale is always up-to-date with the user interactions.

This specification effectively captures the dynamic interaction with the cube’s scale based on user input, as described in the natural language specification.
