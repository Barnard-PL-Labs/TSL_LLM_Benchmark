To translate your natural language description into a TSL specification, we need to structure it into the `always assume` and `always guarantee` blocks. Based on the information provided:

- The cube's scale along the x-axis changes based on whether the up key is pressed.
- A counter increases each frame while the up key is pressed, affecting the cube's scale.
- When the up key is not pressed, the cube's scale returns to a default value of 0.5.

Here is how you can formalize this in TSL:

```tsl
always assume {
  // This block is generally used to define conditions or constraints on inputs but
  // no specific assumptions are needed for the provided scenario beyond the definition of pressUp(e).
}

always guarantee {
  // When the up key is pressed, increment the counter by 1 every frame.
  pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

  // When the up key is not pressed, reset the counter to 0.5.
  !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];

  // Update the cube's scale x-value with the current value of the counter.
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Assumptions**: 
   - This section is left empty as the only needed assumption here is the nature of the `pressUp(e)` predicate, which is already defined to check if the up key is pressed.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - The first guarantee handles the incrementation of the counter (`count`) when the up key is pressed (`pressUp(e)`).
   - The second guarantee ensures that when the up key is not being pressed, the counter is reset to the default value of 0.5.
   - Lastly, it continuously updates the `cube.scale.x` with the current value of `count`. This update is frame-wise reactive to the value of `count` either being incremented or reset, thereby affecting the cube's scale along the x-axis in real-time depending on user input.

This TSL specification captures the dynamic behavior of the cube's scale in response to user interaction with the up arrow key, as per the requirements outlined.
