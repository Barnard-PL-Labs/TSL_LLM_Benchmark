To implement a predicate in JavaScript that detects when the user presses the up arrow key on their keyboard (keyCode for the up arrow key is 38), you can use an event listener that listens for the 'keydown' event. Since the predicate is required to evaluate to a boolean, we will maintain a state variable that tracks whether the up arrow key is currently being pressed.

Here's how you can implement this:

```javascript
// State variable to track whether the up key is pressed
let upKeyPressed = false;

// Function to handle keydown events
function handleKeyDown(event) {
    if (event.keyCode === 38) {  // 38 is the keyCode for the up arrow key
        upKeyPressed = true;
    }
}

// Function to handle keyup events
function handleKeyUp(event) {
    if (event.keyCode === 38) {
        upKeyPressed = false;
    }
}

// Add event listeners to the document for keydown and keyup
document.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
document.addEventListener('keyup', handleKeyUp);

// Predicate function to check if the up key is pressed
function pressUp() {
    return upKeyPressed;
}

// Example usage
// This could be used within a polling loop or another part of your application logic
// where you need to check if the up key is currently pressed.
console.log(pressUp());  // Logs 'true' if the up key is pressed, otherwise 'false'
```

### Explanation:
1. **State Variable (`upKeyPressed`)**: This boolean variable maintains the state of whether the up arrow key is pressed. It is set to `true` when a `keydown` event for the up arrow key occurs and set back to `false` when a `keyup` event for the same key occurs.

2. **Event Handlers (`handleKeyDown` and `handleKeyUp`)**: These functions modify the state variable `upKeyPressed` based on the key events. They check if the event's `keyCode` is 38, which corresponds to the up arrow key.

3. **Event Listeners**: The document has event listeners added for both `keydown` and `keyup` events, which call the respective handlers defined above.

4. **Predicate Function (`pressUp`)**: This function simply returns the current value of `upKeyPressed`, allowing other parts of the application to check if the up arrow key is currently pressed.

This setup ensures that the predicate `pressUp()` correctly reflects the state of the up arrow key at any given time.
