To implement the predicate `pressUp(e)` in a system where we have access to a cube's scale transformation but not directly implementing functions or arbitrary JavaScript functions outside the context of state transition or logic implications, we have to rely on the setup of the system provided. Since we are not directly writing JavaScript code to implement these functionalities, we can design a TSL (Temporal Stream Logic) template which conceptually represents what the interaction would look like if translated into a practical JavaScript environment.

### TSL Template for Cube Interaction and Key Press Event

In a typical TSL setup, you would outline the assumptions about the environment and guarantees about the system responses. However, since we're focusing on a concept where JavaScript might be used (although not implemented directly here), let's provide a conceptual outline of what the TSL might look like if it were supporting such JavaScript interactions. 

```tsl
always assume {
    // The system constantly checks for a "pressUp" event which is a predicate.
    // This would equate to listening for the up arrow key press in a JavaScript context.
    pressUp(e);
}

always guarantee {
    // The guarantee here would be how the system reacts when the up arrow key is pressed.
    // For instance, modifying the cube's scale when the up arrow key is pressed could be depicted.
    pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- 2]; // Hypothetically doubling the scale on the x-axis.
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions**: We assume that an event `pressUp(e)` is checkable in the system, corresponding to whether the up arrow key is pressed. In a direct implementation, this would involve setting up an event listener for the 'keydown' event and checking if the pressed key is the up arrow.

2. **Guarantees**: When the event `pressUp(e)` is true (up arrow key is pressed), there is a reaction specified. Here, it's depicted as changing the cube's scale along the x-axis. This reaction would be implemented in JavaScript by modifying an object's property when the event occurs.

This TSL outline is purely conceptual for the scenario described and serves to illustrate how you might think about translating an interaction handled typically by JavaScript event listeners and handlers into a TSL-like logic framework. In practice, TSL is used for situations where state transitions and their conditions are modeled rather than implementing UI event handling directly.
