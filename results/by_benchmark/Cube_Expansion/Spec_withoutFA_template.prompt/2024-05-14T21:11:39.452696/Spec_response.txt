Here is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // No specific assumptions related to external conditions are outlined
}

always guarantee {
  // When the up button is pressed, increment the counter each frame
  pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

  // When the up button is not pressed, reset the counter to 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];

  // The scale value along the x-axis is updated with the value of the counter
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

This TSL template reflects the behavior described: the cube's scale along the x-axis adjusts based on whether the up key is pressed or not, with dynamic updates to the `count` which directly impacts the `cube.scale.x` value.
