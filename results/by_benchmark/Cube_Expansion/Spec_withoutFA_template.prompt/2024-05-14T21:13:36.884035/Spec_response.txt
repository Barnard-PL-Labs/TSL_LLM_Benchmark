Here's how you can translate the natural language description into a TSL specification:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Optional: You could include assumptions about possible states or sequences. 
  // Since this spec focuses on user input, we might not need to define any assumptions here.
}

always guarantee {
  // When the user presses the up button, the counter (count) increments by 1 every frame.
  pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

  // When the user is not pressing the up button, the counter (count) remains at 0.5.
  !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];

  // The scale value along the x-axis (cube.scale.x) is eventually updated with the value of the counter (count).
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Assumptions**: I've left the assumption block empty as the core functionality revolves around user interaction, and there are no specified assumptions about the environment or other external conditions that affect the system's behavior.

- **Guarantees**: 
  - When the `pressUp(e)` predicate is true (i.e., when the up arrow key is pressed), the counter `count` is incremented by 1 every frame. This is modeled by directly updating the `count` variable.
  - When the `pressUp(e)` predicate is false (i.e., when the up arrow key is not pressed), the counter `count` is set to 0.5, indicating a reset or default state.
  - The cube's scale along the x-axis (`cube.scale.x`) is continuously updated to reflect the value of `count`, ensuring that the cube's scale changes in real-time based on user input. 

This specification models the dynamic behavior of the cube scaling in response to the up key being pressed and ensures that the scale resets when the key is not pressed.
