To implement a predicate `pressUp(e)` that checks if the up arrow key is pressed on a keyboard using JavaScript, you would typically add an event listener to the `window` object to listen for the `keydown` event. This predicate will then evaluate to `true` whenever the up arrow key is pressed. Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
// Define a variable to track the state of the up arrow key
let upKeyPressed = false;

// Add an event listener to the window for the 'keydown' event
window.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
    if (event.key === "ArrowUp") {
        upKeyPressed = true;
    }
});

// Add an event listener to the window for the 'keyup' event
window.addEventListener('keyup', function(event) {
    if (event.key === "ArrowUp") {
        upKeyPressed = false;
    }
});

// Predicate function to check if the up arrow key is pressed
function pressUp() {
    return upKeyPressed;
}
```

Explanation:
- The variable `upKeyPressed` is used to track whether the up arrow key is currently pressed.
- The `keydown` event listener sets `upKeyPressed` to `true` when the up arrow key is pressed.
- The `keyup` event listener sets `upKeyPressed` to `false` when the up arrow key is released.
- The `pressUp` function returns the current value of `upKeyPressed`, making it a predicate that tells you whether the up arrow key is pressed at any given moment.

This setup ensures that the predicate `pressUp()` accurately reflects the state of the up arrow key.
