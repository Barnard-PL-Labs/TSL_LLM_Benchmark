To implement the predicate `pressUp(e)` as described, you'll need to create an event listener that listens for `keydown` events on the document. When the up arrow key is pressed, the predicate should return true, and otherwise, it should return false.

Because the requirement specifies not to use any additional functions and only to focus on predicates, I will directly create an event listener that sets a global or widely accessible variable to true or false based on the key press (specifically the up arrow key). This can be done without explicitly returning a boolean from a function, instead indirectly using the state of the variable to determine the truth value of the predicate.

Hereâ€™s how you can implement it in JavaScript, keeping the functionality encapsulated and reusable:

```javascript
// Declare a variable to keep track of the up arrow key press state
let isUpKeyPressed = false;

// Add event listener on the document for 'keydown' to detect the up arrow key press
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
    if (event.key === "ArrowUp") {
        isUpKeyPressed = true;
    }
});

// Add event listener for 'keyup' to reset the state when the key is released
document.addEventListener('keyup', function(event) {
    if (event.key === "ArrowUp") {
        isUpKeyPressed = false;
    }
});

// The predicate uses the state of isUpKeyPressed to determine if the up key is currently pressed
function pressUp() {
    return isUpKeyPressed;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Variable `isUpKeyPressed`**: This variable keeps track of whether the up arrow key is currently pressed. It acts as the state behind the `pressUp` predicate.
- **Event Listeners**: Two event listeners are set up on the document:
  - **`keydown` listener**: Checks if the key pressed is the up arrow key (`ArrowUp`). If it is, `isUpKeyPressed` is set to true.
  - **`keyup` listener**: Checks if the key released is the up arrow key. If it is, `isUpKeyPressed` is set to false. This ensures the state is only true while the key is held down.
- **Function `pressUp()`**: This function acts as the predicate and returns the state of `isUpKeyPressed`, effectively indicating whether the up arrow key is currently pressed.

This setup adheres to the requirement by focusing solely on the predicate logic without implementing additional functions, and directly interacts with the system API as stipulated.
