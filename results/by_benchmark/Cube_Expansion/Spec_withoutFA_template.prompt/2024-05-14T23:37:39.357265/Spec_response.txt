Here is the TSL specification based on the natural language description provided:

```tsl
always assume {
  // No specific environmental assumptions are required beyond input detection.
}

always guarantee {
  // When the user presses the up button, increment the counter each frame.
  pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

  // When the user is not pressing the up button, set the counter back to 0.5.
  !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];

  // The scale value along the x-axis is updated with the value of the counter.
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

This TSL specification captures the dynamics of the cube scale in response to the user pressing and releasing the up key based on your description. It uses a counter that increments when the key is pressed and resets when the key is not pressed, with these changes immediately reflected in the cube's x-axis scale.
