Here's the TSL specification based on the provided description and requirements for the cube's behavior with respect to user input on the up key.

```tsl
always assume {
    // No specific environmental assumptions needed for this interaction
}

always guarantee {
    // Initialize the counter and scale when the up key is not pressed
    !pressUp(e) -> ([count <- 0.5] && [cube.scale.x <- 0.5]);

    // When the up key is pressed, increment the counter by 1 every frame
    pressUp(e) -> X ([count <- count + 1]);

    // Update the cube's scale along the x-axis with the current counter value
    [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Assumptions**: There are no specific environmental assumptions made here; the input is either the up key is pressed or not.
- **Guarantees**:
  1. When the up key is not pressed, both the `count` and `cube.scale.x` are set to 0.5.
  2. When the up key is pressed, the `count` variable increments by 1 in every subsequent frame.
  3. The cube's scale on the x-axis (`cube.scale.x`) is continuously updated to reflect the current value of `count`. This is done independently of the key press state to ensure it always holds the latest `count` value.
