To implement the predicate `pressUp(e)` which checks if the user presses the up arrow key on their keyboard in JavaScript, no functions from the system API are required apart from accessing the event `e`. Below is a possible implementation within the constraints you've described, assuming we need to use a TSL style setup for creating the predicates:

Since we are not writing JavaScript code directly but rather describing how one would integrate this with a TSL template, letâ€™s outline how this would typically be structured:

### JavaScript Event Setup
Normally, to capture key events in JavaScript, you would set up an event listener on the document object for `keydown` events, and then check if the key pressed is the up arrow key. The capture of this event would then set some state that the TSL system could check.

### TSL Predicate Setup
In TSL, the actual movement or state transition based on the key press would be controlled by the TSL statements in the `always guarantee` block based on the predicate defined in the `always assume` block.

Here's how you might structure your TSL file to integrate the JavaScript functionality:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Here, we define the predicate for pressing the up arrow key. 
  // It's assumed that there's a JavaScript function or mechanism outside of TSL 
  // to bind this predicate to actual key presses.
  pressUp(e);
}

always guarantee {
  // Example reaction in TSL based on the predicate
  // If the up key is pressed, increase the cube's scale along x-axis
  pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- cube.scale.x + 0.1];
}
```

### JavaScript Predicate Integration
If you were to implement this outside of TSL directly using JavaScript:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
  if (event.key === 'ArrowUp') {
    // Assuming there is a way to communicate this state to the TSL system
    // For example, setting a global variable or calling a function that TSL can check
    window.isUpKeyPressed = true;
  }
});

document.addEventListener('keyup', function(event) {
  if (event.key === 'ArrowUp') {
    window.isUpKeyPressed = false;
  }
});
```

In the TSL system, you would have the mechanism to check `window.isUpKeyPressed` as the implementation of the `pressUp(e)` predicate. This would typically be done via integration code that bridges the JavaScript environment with the TSL runtime, ensuring that the state changes in JavaScript are reflected in the predicates used in TSL.
