Here is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // No specific environmental assumptions are needed for this example
}

always guarantee {
  // When the user is not pressing the up button, the counter count remains at 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];

  // When the user presses the up button, the counter count increments by 1 every frame
  pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

  // The scale value along the x-axis is updated with the value of the counter
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

This TSL specification ensures that the cube's scale along the x-axis is controlled by user input, with the scale being reset to 0.5 when the up key is not pressed and incrementing when the up key is held down.
