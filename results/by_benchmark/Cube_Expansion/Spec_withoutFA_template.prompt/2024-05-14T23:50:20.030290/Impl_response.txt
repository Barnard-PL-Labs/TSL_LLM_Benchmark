To implement the predicate `pressUp(e)` that checks whether the user has pressed the up arrow key on their keyboard using JavaScript, you need to define an event listener for the `keydown` event. This event will monitor key presses, and you will check if the key pressed is the up arrow key.

Here's how you can implement this:

```javascript
let isUpPressed = false;

// Function to check if the 'up' arrow key is pressed
function checkUpKeyPress(event) {
    if (event.key === "ArrowUp") {
        isUpPressed = true;
    } else {
        isUpPressed = false;
    }
}

// Adding event listener to the whole document
document.addEventListener('keydown', checkUpKeyPress);

// Adding event listener to reset the key state when it is not pressed
document.addEventListener('keyup', (event) => {
    if (event.key === "ArrowUp") {
        isUpPressed = false;
    }
});

// Predicate function to be used as per requirement
function pressUp() {
    return isUpPressed;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Variable Declaration**: `isUpPressed` is a boolean that keeps track of whether the up arrow key is currently pressed (`true`) or not (`false`).

2. **checkUpKeyPress Function**: This function is triggered whenever a key is pressed down. It checks if the key pressed is the up arrow key (`ArrowUp`). If it is, `isUpPressed` is set to `true`. If any other key is pressed, `isUpPressed` is set to `false` to ensure the predicate only returns `true` when the specified key is pressed.

3. **Event Listeners**:
   - The `keydown` event listener calls `checkUpKeyPress` to update the state of `isUpPressed`.
   - The `keyup` event listener resets `isUpPressed` to `false` when the up arrow key is released. This ensures that `isUpPressed` accurately reflects the current state of the up arrow key.

4. **Predicate Function `pressUp`**: This function simply returns the current state of `isUpPressed`, allowing other parts of the system to check if the up arrow key is currently pressed.

This setup ensures that `pressUp()` will be `true` whenever the up arrow key is pressed and `false` otherwise, directly reflecting the keyboard input in real-time.
