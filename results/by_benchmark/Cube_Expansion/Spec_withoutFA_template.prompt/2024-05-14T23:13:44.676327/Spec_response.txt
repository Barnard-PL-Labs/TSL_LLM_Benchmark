Here's how to translate your natural language description into a TSL specification:

```tsl
always assume {
    // Simplicity: No constraints are assumed from the environment
}

always guarantee {
    // Guarantee 1: When the up button is pressed, increment the counter by 1 each frame
    pressUp(e) -> ([count <- count + 1]);

    // Guarantee 2: When the up button is not pressed, reset the counter to 0.5 
    !pressUp(e) -> ([count <- 0.5]);

    // Guarantee 3: Update the cube's scale along the x-axis with the value of the counter
    [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Assume Block:** No specific assumptions about the environment are necessary for this setup.

- **Guarantee Block:**
  1. **Incrementing Counter:** When the user presses the up button, which is detected by `pressUp(e)`, the counter variable `count` is incremented by 1 each frame. This is described in the guarantee using the syntax `[variable <- new_value]` where `count` is set to `count + 1`.
  
  2. **Resetting Counter:** When the up button is not pressed, denoted by `!pressUp(e)`, the counter `count` is reset to 0.5.
  
  3. **Updating Cube Scale:** Independently of the button press, the scale of the cube along the x-axis, `cube.scale.x`, is continuously updated to the current value of `count`. This ensures that the cube's scale responds in real-time to the changes in the counter value driven by the user input.

This specification directly maps the user interaction described in the natural language into TSL, ensuring the cube's behavior is reactive and dynamic based on user input.
