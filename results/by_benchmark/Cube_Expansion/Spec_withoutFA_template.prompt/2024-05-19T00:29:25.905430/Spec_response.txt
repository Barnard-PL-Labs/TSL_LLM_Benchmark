Below is the TSL specification based on your description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // No specific environmental assumptions mentioned
}

always guarantee {
  // When the user is not pressing the up button, the counter (count) remains at 0.5.
  !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];

  // When the user presses the up button, increment the counter (count)
  pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

  // The scale value along the x-axis (cube.scale.x) is updated with the value of the counter (count).
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

This specification describes the behavior of a cube's x-axis scale as it reacts to user input from pressing the up arrow key. The cube's scale is controlled by a counter that updates based on whether the up arrow key is pressed or not. If the up key is pressed, the counter increments by 1 each frame; if not, it resets to 0.5. The cube's scale then updates to reflect the value of this counter.
