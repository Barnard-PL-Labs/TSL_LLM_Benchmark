To implement the specified predicates using TSL (Temporal Stream Logic) and JavaScript, we need to define the system's behavior in response to environmental inputs, such as keyboard events. Here, we will write a JavaScript code snippet that integrates with a given API for a 3D cube to check if the up arrow key is pressed. We'll use the TSL framework for assumptions and guarantees based on this behavior.

### JavaScript Implementation for `pressUp(e)`

First, we need to capture the "up arrow key" press event using event listeners in JavaScript. The predicate `pressUp(e)` will return `true` when the up arrow key is pressed and return `false` otherwise.

```javascript
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
    if (event.key === 'ArrowUp') {
        pressUp(true);
    } else {
        pressUp(false);
    }
});

function pressUp(isPressed) {
    console.log('Up arrow key pressed:', isPressed);
    return isPressed;
}
```

### TSL Implementation

We will describe the expected behavior in the TSL framework by assuming the environment input and guaranteeing the system's response.

#### TSL Template
```tsl
always assume {
    // Assuming that the up arrow press can be true or false.
    (pressUp(e) || !pressUp(e));
}

always guarantee {
    // Guarantees that if the up arrow is pressed, cube.scale.x is updated or some action is performed.
    pressUp(e) -> [actionOnPressUp()]; // Define actionOnPressUp for specific actions when up is pressed
}
```

#### Explanation
- **Assume**: We haven't implemented any specific assumptions about the environment other than the fact that the up arrow key can either be pressed or not at any time.
- **Guarantee**: Whenever the up arrow key is pressed, as detected by the `pressUp(e)` predicate, a certain action (`actionOnPressUp()`) is triggered. This action should be defined in the JavaScript part to do something meaningful, like perhaps modifying `cube.scale.x` or similar, depending on the requirements.

#### Additional JavaScript for actionOnPressUp (Example)
```javascript
function actionOnPressUp() {
    // Example action: Increase cube's scale along the x-axis
    cube.scale.x += 0.1;
    console.log('Updated cube.scale.x:', cube.scale.x);
}
```

The above implementation in JavaScript and TSL ensures that the system reacts to the pressing of the up arrow key by executing defined actions, maintaining a clean separation between the capturing of user input and the response logic. This approach aligns with the principles of temporal logic in system design and verification.
