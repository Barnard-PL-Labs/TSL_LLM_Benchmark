Below is the TSL specification based on the given natural language description for handling the scaling of a cube along the x-axis in response to user interaction with the up key:

```tsl
always assume {
  // This section is intentionally left empty as the description does not specify any environmental assumptions that affect the guarantees.
}

always guarantee {
  // When the up key is pressed, increment the counter 'count' by 1 every frame
  pressUp(e) -> ([count <- count + 1] W !pressUp(e));
  
  // When the up key is not pressed, set the counter 'count' to 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];
  
  // The cube's scale along the x-axis follows the value of 'count'
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

Explanation:
1. The `pressUp(e)` predicate is used to check if the up key is being pressed. If it is, the `count` variable is incremented by 1 for each frame until the up key is released (`!pressUp(e)`), as indicated by the use of the Weak Until operator `W`.
2. When the up key is not pressed (`!pressUp(e)`), the `count` is set to 0.5. This is specified in the guarantee section to ensure that the scale resets when the key is not being pressed.
3. The scale of the cube along the x-axis (`cube.scale.x`) is continuously updated to match the value of `count`, ensuring that any changes in `count` due to pressing or releasing the up key are reflected in the cube's scale.
