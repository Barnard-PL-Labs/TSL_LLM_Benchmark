Here is the corresponding TSL specification based on the natural language description provided, detailing the behavior of cube scaling in response to the up key press:

```tsl
always assume{
  // No explicit assumptions needed for this specification
}

always guarantee{
  // When the up key is pressed, increment the counter each frame
  pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

  // When the up key is not pressed, set the counter to 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];

  // Always set the cube's scale along the x-axis to the current value of the counter
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

In this TSL specification:
- The `pressUp(e)` predicate checks if the up key is pressed.
- The `count` variable is used to keep track of the scale increment when the up key is pressed.
- When `pressUp(e)` is true, the `count` is incremented by 1 each frame.
- When `pressUp(e)` is false, which means the up key is not being pressed, the `count` is reset to 0.5.
- The `cube.scale.x` is continuously updated to match the value of `count`, ensuring the cube's scale changes in response to the up key press.
