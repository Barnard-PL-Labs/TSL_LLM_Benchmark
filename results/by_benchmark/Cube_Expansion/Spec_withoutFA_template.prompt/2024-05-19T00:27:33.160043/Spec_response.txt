Here is the TSL specification based on the provided description and requirements:

```tsl
always assume {
  // No assumptions are explicitly required for this simple input-reactive model
}

always guarantee {
  // When the up button is pressed, increment the counter by 1 every frame
  pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

  // When the up button is not being pressed, reset the counter to 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];

  // Update the cube's scale along the x-axis with the value of the counter
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Assumptions**: None are specified because the environment's behavior (key press detection) is straightforward and doesn't involve complex conditions or interactions with other systems.
- **Guarantees**:
  1. When the up key (`pressUp(e)`) is pressed, the `count` variable increments by 1 for every frame the key remains pressed. This is modeled by the assignment `[count <- count + 1]`.
  2. When the up key is not pressed (`!pressUp(e)`), the `count` variable is set to 0.5, ensuring the cube's scale resets when the key is released.
  3. The cubeâ€™s scale along the x-axis (`cube.scale.x`) is continuously updated to match the value of `count`, ensuring the visual scale of the cube changes as expected based on user input.
