Here is the corresponding TSL specification based on your natural language description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // There is no specific assumption needed for this scenario
}

always guarantee {
  // Initialize the counter to 0.5 when the up key is not pressed
  !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];
  
  // Increment the counter by 1 every frame when the up key is pressed
  pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];
  
  // Update the scale of the cube along the x-axis with the value of count
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions**: There are no explicit environmental assumptions mentioned or needed based on the description. 

2. **Guarantees**:
   - The first guarantee ensures that the `count` variable is set to `0.5` when the up key is not being pressed. This reflects the base scale state of the cube along the x-axis.
   - The second guarantee describes the behavior when the up key is pressed, incrementing the `count` by 1 for each frame as long as the key remains pressed. This simulates the continuous increase in scale while the key is held.
   - The final guarantee updates the cube's scale along the x-axis (`cube.scale.x`) with the current value of `count`, reflecting the changes in scale in response to the up key press. 

This specification uses TSL's reactive guarantee model to continuously update system variables based on user input and internal counters, capturing the dynamic behavior described in the natural language requirement.
