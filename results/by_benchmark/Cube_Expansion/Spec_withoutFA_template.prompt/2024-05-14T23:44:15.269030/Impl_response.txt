To implement the predicate `pressUp(e)` in JavaScript, we need to add an event listener to the document that listens for the `keydown` event. This predicate will track whether the up arrow key (which corresponds to the key code `38`) is pressed. The predicate should return `true` when the up key is pressed and `false` otherwise. We can achieve this by setting up a flag that changes state based on the key press events.

Below is the JavaScript code to implement the predicate `pressUp(e)`:

```javascript
// Define a variable to keep track of the up arrow key state
let upKeyPressed = false;

// Add event listener for keydown to detect when the up key is pressed
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
    if (event.keyCode === 38) { // 38 is the key code for the up arrow key
        upKeyPressed = true;
    }
});

// Add event listener for keyup to reset the up key state when it is released
document.addEventListener('keyup', function(event) {
    if (event.keyCode === 38) {
        upKeyPressed = false;
    }
});

// Predicate function to check if the up key is pressed
function pressUp() {
    return upKeyPressed;
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Variable Initialization**: `upKeyPressed` is a boolean variable initialized to `false`. It acts as a flag to record whether the up arrow key is currently being pressed.

2. **Event Listeners**: Two event listeners are added to the global `document` object:
   - A `keydown` listener sets `upKeyPressed` to `true` if the up arrow key (key code 38) is pressed.
   - A `keyup` listener sets `upKeyPressed` back to `false` when the up arrow key is released.

3. **Predicate Function**: The function `pressUp()` is defined to return the current state of `upKeyPressed`. This function effectively serves as the predicate required by the system, indicating whether the up key is actively being pressed at any given time.

This implementation allows you to use the `pressUp()` function within other parts of your system to check the state of the up arrow key at any moment in a manner that is compatible with event-driven programming in JavaScript.
