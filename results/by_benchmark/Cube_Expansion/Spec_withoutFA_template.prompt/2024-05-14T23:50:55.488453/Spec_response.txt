Here's how to translate the provided natural language description into a TSL specification:

```tsl
always assume {
  // No specific assumptions about the environment
}

always guarantee {
  // When the up button is pressed, increment the counter each frame
  pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

  // When the up button is not pressed, reset the counter to 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];

  // Update the cube's scale.x with the value of count
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```
