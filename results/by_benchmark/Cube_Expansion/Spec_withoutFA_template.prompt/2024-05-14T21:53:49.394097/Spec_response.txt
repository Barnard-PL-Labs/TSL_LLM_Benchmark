Here is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description and requirements for managing a cube's scale along the x-axis in response to the user pressing the up key:

```tsl
always assume {
    // No explicit assumptions are stated; usually, one would define mutual exclusion or input conditions here if needed.
}

always guarantee {
  // Check if the up button is pressed
  pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];
  
  // If the up button is not pressed, reset the counter to 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];
  
  // Update the cube's scale along the x-axis with the value of the counter
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions**: No specific assumptions about the environment or other inputs are needed in this case, as the problem description doesn't specify any interactions or conflicts with other events or states.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - If the user presses the up button (`pressUp(e)`), the counter variable (`count`) is incremented by 1 every frame. This is represented by `[count <- count + 1]`.
   - If the up button is not pressed (`!pressUp(e)`), the counter is reset to 0.5. This ensures that the cube's scale returns to its initial size when the key is not being pressed.
   - Regardless of the state of the `pressUp` predicate, the cube’s scale along the x-axis (`cube.scale.x`) is continuously set to match the current value of the counter (`count`). This happens every frame, ensuring the cube’s scale is responsive to real-time changes in the counter’s value.
