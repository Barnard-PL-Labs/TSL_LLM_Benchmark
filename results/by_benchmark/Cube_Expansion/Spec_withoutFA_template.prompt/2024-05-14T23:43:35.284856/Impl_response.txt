To implement the predicate `pressUp(e)` as described, we will add an event listener to the `document` object in JavaScript that listens for the `keydown` event. This predicate will check if the up arrow key (which has a keycode of 38) is pressed. Since predicates in TSL return a boolean, the implementation will ensure that the predicate `pressUp(e)` is true when the up arrow key is pressed and false otherwise.

Here is how you can implement this in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Variable to keep track of the up arrow key press state
let isUpKeyPressed = false;

// Adding an event listener for the 'keydown' event
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
    if (event.keyCode === 38) { // 38 is the keycode for the up arrow key
        isUpKeyPressed = true;
    }
});

// Adding an event listener for the 'keyup' event to reset the key press state
document.addEventListener('keyup', function(event) {
    if (event.keyCode === 38) {
        isUpKeyPressed = false;
    }
});

// Predicate function to check if the up key is pressed
function pressUp() {
    return isUpKeyPressed;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Variable isUpKeyPressed**: This boolean variable holds the state of the up arrow key. It is initially set to false.

2. **Event Listener for 'keydown'**: The `keydown` event is fired when any key on the keyboard is pressed down. Inside this event listener, we check if the keycode of the pressed key is 38 (which corresponds to the up arrow key). If it is, we set `isUpKeyPressed` to true.

3. **Event Listener for 'keyup'**: The `keyup` event is fired when a key is released. Similar to the `keydown` event, we check if the keycode of the released key is 38. If it is, we reset `isUpKeyPressed` to false, indicating that the up arrow key is no longer being pressed.

4. **Function pressUp()**: This is the predicate function that returns the current state of `isUpKeyPressed`. It returns true if the up arrow key is currently pressed, otherwise it returns false.

This implementation ensures that the predicate `pressUp()` reflects the real-time state of the up arrow key being pressed and can be used in any logic or system that needs to monitor this specific key press event.
