Here's the TSL specification based on your provided description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // No special environmental assumptions required for this specification
}

always guarantee {
  // Define the counter for incrementing the scale
  pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];
  
  // When the up button is not pressed, reset the counter to 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];
  
  // Update the cube's scale along the x-axis with the value of the counter
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

This TSL specification encapsulates the behavior that when the up button is pressed, the `count` variable increments with each frame and when the up button is not pressed, `count` is reset to 0.5. The cube's x-axis scale is always set to this `count` value.
