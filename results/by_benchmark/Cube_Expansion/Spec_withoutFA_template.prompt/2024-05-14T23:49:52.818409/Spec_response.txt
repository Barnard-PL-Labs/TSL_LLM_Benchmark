Here's a TSL specification based on the given natural language description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Assume no conflicting inputs or conditions are specified.
}

always guarantee {
  // When the up button is pressed, increment the counter each frame. 
  pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

  // When the up button is not being pressed, reset the counter to 0.5.
  !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];

  // The cube's scale along the x-axis is updated to match the value of the counter.
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

Explanation:
1. The assumptions section remains empty as there are no explicit environmental constraints or conflicting inputs given in the description.
2. The guarantees outline the behavior of the counter and the cube's scale:
   - When the up button is pressed (`pressUp(e)`), the counter `count` increases by 1 every frame.
   - When the up button is not pressed (`!pressUp(e)`), the counter `count` is reset to a constant value of 0.5.
   - Independently of the button state, the scale of the cube along the x-axis (`cube.scale.x`) is continuously set to the current value of `count`. This ensures the cube's size is correctly updated every frame according to the counter's value.
