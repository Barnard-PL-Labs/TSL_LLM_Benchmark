Here's the TSL specification based on the natural language description given:

```tsl
always assume {
  // There are no specific environmental assumptions that need to be explicitly stated
}

always guarantee {
  // When the up key is pressed, increment the counter each frame
  pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

  // When the up key is not pressed, reset the counter to 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];

  // The cube's x-axis scale is updated to the value of count
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

In this specification:
- The `always assume` block does not need any specific conditions based on the information provided.
- The `always guarantee` section deals with the increment of a counter when the up key is pressed and resetting this counter when the up key is not pressed. The scale of the cube along the x-axis is directly linked to the value of this counter.
