Here's the TSL specification based on the natural language description provided:

```tsl
always assume {
  // There are no specific environment assumptions mentioned that affect the logic directly.
}

always guarantee {
  // Guarantee that when the up button is not pressed, the counter remains at 0.5.
  !(pressUp(e)) -> [count <- 0.5];

  // Guarantee that when the up button is pressed, the counter increments by 1 every frame.
  pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

  // The scale value along the x-axis is updated with the value of the counter.
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

This TSL code follows the requirements:
1. It initializes and maintains the counter at 0.5 when the up key is not pressed.
2. It increments the counter each frame while the up key is pressed.
3. It continuously updates the cube's x-axis scale to match the counter's value.
