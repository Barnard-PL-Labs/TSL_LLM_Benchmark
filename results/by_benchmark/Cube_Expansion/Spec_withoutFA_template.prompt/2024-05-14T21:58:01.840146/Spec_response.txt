Here's how you would translate your natural language description into a TSL specification:

```tsl
always assume {
  // No specific environmental assumptions needed for this interaction
}

always guarantee {
  // When the up button is pressed, increment the counter each frame
  pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

  // When the up button is not pressed, reset the counter to 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];

  // Continuously update the cube's scale.x with the value of count
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

In this TSL specification:
- We have no particular assumptions required, so the `always assume` block remains empty.
- We define guarantees corresponding to the behavior of the cube when the up key is pressed and when it is not.
- The `pressUp(e)` predicate is used to check if the up key is pressed, and actions are defined based on this condition.
- The `count` variable is manipulated depending on whether the up key is pressed or not. When pressed, it increments by 1 each frame, and when not pressed, it is set back to 0.5.
- The cubeâ€™s scale along the x-axis (`cube.scale.x`) is consistently set to reflect the value of `count`.
