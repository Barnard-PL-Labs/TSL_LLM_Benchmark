To translate the requirements into a JavaScript implementation, we will need to utilize event listeners to detect when specific keys are pressed on the keyboard. Specifically, we will implement the `pressUp(e)` predicate that checks if the 'Up' arrow key has been pressed.

Here's how you can achieve this using JavaScript:

```javascript
// We'll use a variable to represent the state of the 'Up' arrow key.
let upKeyPressed = false;

// Adding an event listener to the window object to listen for 'keydown' events.
// This will set upKeyPressed to true when the 'Up' arrow key is pressed.
window.addEventListener('keydown', function(e) {
    if (e.key === 'ArrowUp') {
        upKeyPressed = true;
    }
});

// Adding an event listener to reset the upKeyPressed when the key is released
window.addEventListener('keyup', function(e) {
    if (e.key === 'ArrowUp') {
        upKeyPressed = false;
    }
});

// Predicate function to check if the 'Up' arrow key is pressed.
function pressUp() {
    return upKeyPressed;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Variable Definition**: `upKeyPressed` is a boolean variable that holds the state of the 'Up' arrow key, whether it is pressed or not.

2. **Event Listener for Key Down**: We add an event listener to the `window` object that listens for 'keydown' events. When a 'keydown' event occurs, and the key is the 'Up' arrow ('ArrowUp'), we set `upKeyPressed` to `true`.

3. **Event Listener for Key Up**: Another event listener on the `window` object listens for 'keyup' events. This reverses the state set by the 'keydown' eventâ€”when the 'Up' arrow key is released, `upKeyPressed` is set back to `false`.

4. **Predicate Function**: The `pressUp()` function is a simple predicate that returns the value of `upKeyPressed`. It returns `true` if the 'Up' arrow key is currently pressed, and `false` otherwise.

This setup ensures that the state of the 'Up' arrow key is accurately tracked, and the predicate function provides a correct response based on this state. This approach respects the requirements of implementing predicates without creating additional unnecessary functions.
