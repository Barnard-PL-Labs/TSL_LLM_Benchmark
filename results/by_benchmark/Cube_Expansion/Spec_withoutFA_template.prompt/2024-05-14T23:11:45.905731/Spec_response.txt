Here is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // No specific environmental assumptions expressed in the description
}

always guarantee {
  // When the up button is pressed, increment the counter by 1 every frame
  pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];
  
  // When the up button is not pressed, reset the counter to 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];
  
  // Continuously update the cube's scale along the x-axis with the value of the counter
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
``` 

This specification captures the behavior of the cubeâ€™s scale adjustment based on the pressing and releasing of the up key, along with the associated changes in the counter that determines the scale value.
