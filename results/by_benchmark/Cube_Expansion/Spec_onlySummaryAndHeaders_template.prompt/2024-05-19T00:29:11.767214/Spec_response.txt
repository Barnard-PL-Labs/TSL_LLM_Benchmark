To translate your natural language description into a TSL specification, we'll define both the assumptions about the environment and the guarantees about how the system (in this case, the cube's scale) should behave in response to these assumptions. Here's the TSL specification based on your description:

```TSL
always assume {
  // Define the nature of the pressUp(e) event
  (pressUp(e) || !pressUp(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // When the up key is not pressed, set the cube's scale along the x-axis to 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- 0.5];

  // When the up key is pressed, increment the scale along the x-axis
  // The counter 't' increments each frame the key is pressed
  pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- cube.scale.x + 0.01];

  // When the key is released, the scale immediately returns to 0.5
  // This is implicitly covered by the condition when pressUp(e) is not true
}
```

In this TSL specification:
1. `always assume` block contains a simple assumption that the `pressUp(e)` event can either be true or false, indicating whether the up key is pressed or not.
2. `always guarantee` block defines how the cube's scale along the x-axis should behave:
   - When the up key is not being pressed, the cube's scale is set to 0.5.
   - When the up key is pressed, the cube's scale along the x-axis increments by 0.01 each frame.
   - When the key is released, the scale resets to 0.5, which is implied by the negation of `pressUp(e)`.
