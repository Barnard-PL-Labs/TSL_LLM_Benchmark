To translate the natural language description into a TSL specification, we need to model the behavior of the cube's x-axis scaling in response to pressing the up key. Here's how you could write it in TSL:

```tsl
always assume {
    // Definition for the interaction with the up key, ensuring the pressUp(e) predicate captures the key press event
}

always guarantee {
    // The cube's x-axis scale starts at 0.5 when the up key is not pressed
    !pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- 0.5];
    
    // When the up key is pressed, increment the scale value based on a counter 't' that increases each frame the key is pressed
    pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- cube.scale.x + 0.01] W !pressUp(e);
    
    // When the key is released, the scale value immediately returns to 0.5
    !pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- 0.5];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions**: In the `always assume` block, we include assumptions about the environment and user interactions, such as the behavior of the `pressUp(e)` predicate. Here, it's assumed that this predicate accurately captures the up key presses.

2. **Guarantees**: In the `always guarantee` block:
   - The scale of the cube along the x-axis is set to 0.5 when the up key is not pressed.
   - When the up key is pressed, the cube's scale on the x-axis increases by 0.01 for each frame the key is held down. This continues until the up key is released.
   - Once the up key is released, the scale immediately resets to 0.5.
  
This TSL specification formalizes the described behavior of scaling a cube in response to keyboard input, adhering to the constraints and behaviors outlined in the natural language description. Adjustments to the increment value (0.01 in this case) and initial scale (0.5) can be modified based on further specifications or desired behavior.
