Here is the TSL specification based on the described behavior of the cube reacting to the up key press:

```tsl
always assume {
  // No specific assumptions required for this scenario
}

always guarantee {
  // When the up key is pressed, increment cube.scale.x each frame
  pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- t] W !pressUp(e);

  // When the up key is not pressed, reset cube.scale.x to 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- 0.5];
}
```

In this TSL code:
- The `pressUp(e)` predicate checks if the up key is pressed.
- When `pressUp(e)` is true, the scale of the cube along the x-axis (`cube.scale.x`) is set to increment based on a counter `t` that presumably increases each frame. This increment continues until the up key is no longer pressed (`!pressUp(e)`).
- When the up key is not pressed (`!pressUp(e)`), the scale of the cube along the x-axis is immediately reset to 0.5.
