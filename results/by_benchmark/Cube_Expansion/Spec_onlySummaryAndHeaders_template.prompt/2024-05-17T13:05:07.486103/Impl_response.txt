To implement the predicate `pressUp(e)` using JavaScript, you need to set up an event listener for the `keydown` event that specifically checks for the pressing of the up arrow key on the keyboard. Since predicates return a boolean, this function should effectively determine if the up arrow key (`ArrowUp`) is being pressed.

Here's how you would write this:

```javascript
// Assuming there exists a variable to track the state of the up arrow key
let isUpKeyPressed = false;

// Setup an event listener on the document to listen for 'keydown' events
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
    if (event.key === 'ArrowUp') {
        isUpKeyPressed = true;
    }
});

// Setup an event listener on the document to listen for 'keyup' events
document.addEventListener('keyup', function(event) {
    if (event.key === 'ArrowUp') {
        isUpKeyPressed = false;
    }
});

// Predicate function to check if the up key is pressed
function pressUp() {
    return isUpKeyPressed;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **State Variable (`isUpKeyPressed`)**: This variable keeps track of whether the up arrow key is currently pressed. It's initialized to false.

2. **Event Listeners**: 
   - The `keydown` event listener checks if the key pressed is the up arrow key. If it is, `isUpKeyPressed` is set to true.
   - The `keyup` event listener checks if the key released is the up arrow key. If it is, `isUpKeyPressed` is set to false.

3. **Predicate Function (`pressUp`)**: This function returns the boolean value of `isUpKeyPressed`, indicating whether the up arrow key is currently being pressed.

This setup ensures that the predicate correctly reflects the state of the up arrow key at any given time, adjusting as the key is pressed and released.
