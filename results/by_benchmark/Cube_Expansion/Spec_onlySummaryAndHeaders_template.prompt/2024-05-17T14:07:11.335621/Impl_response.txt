Given the constraints that you have provided and focusing on the TSL template implementation for the system environment, it appears that you want to handle a predicate related to user interaction (key press) and how it affects a property of a 3D object (cube's scale). Below is how you can define this in a TSL template setting:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Predicate for the up arrow key press
  pressUp(e);
}

always guarantee {
  // When the up key is pressed, set the cube's x-scale to a specific value, e.g., 2
  pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- 2];

  // When the up key is not pressed, set the cube's x-scale to its default value, e.g., 1
  !pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- 1];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assume Block**: We include the predicate `pressUp(e)` which checks if the up arrow key is pressed. This predicate requires an external environment setup where the key press state can be captured, typically implemented in JavaScript using an event listener for `keydown` events.

2. **Guarantee Block**:
   - If the up key is pressed (`pressUp(e)`), the scale along the x-axis of the cube is set to 2.
   - If the up key is not pressed (`!pressUp(e)`), the scale along the x-axis of the cube reverts to its default value, which is 1 in this case.

### Note:
This TSL template assumes that the predicates and their corresponding behaviors are provided or can be integrated into the system environment through an appropriate API or event handling mechanism. In actual implementations, you would need JavaScript or similar to define the real-time behavior of `pressUp(e)`, typically involving an event listener that updates a state variable or directly interacts with the system API to adjust `cube.scale.x`.

Since JavaScript implementation was mentioned but you instructed to not implement any functions, I have omitted JavaScript code and focused only on the TSL template setup. If JavaScript implementation is needed later for actual behavioral definitions, that would involve setting up event listeners and state management accordingly.
