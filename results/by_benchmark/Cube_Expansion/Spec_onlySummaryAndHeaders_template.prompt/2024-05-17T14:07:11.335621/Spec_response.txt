Here's the TSL specification for controlling a cube's scale along the x-axis based on user input on the up key:

```tsl
always assume {
  // No specific assumptions needed about environment inputs or states for this scenario
}

always guarantee {
  // When the up key is not pressed, the cube's scale.x should be 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- 0.5];

  // When the up key is pressed, increment the scale.x value by a counter that increases each frame
  pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- cube.scale.x + 0.1];
}
```

This specification ensures that the cube's scale resets to 0.5 whenever the up key is not pressed and increments by 0.1 along the x-axis for each frame the up key remains pressed.
