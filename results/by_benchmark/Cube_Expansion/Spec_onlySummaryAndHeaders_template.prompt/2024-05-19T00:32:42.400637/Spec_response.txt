Here is the TSL specification based on your natural language description:

```
always assume {
  // Define the behavior of the up key pressing as an event
  (pressUp(e) || !pressUp(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // When the up key is not pressed, set the cube's scale along the x-axis to 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- 0.5];
  
  // When the up key is pressed, increment the cube's scale along the x-axis by a counter
  // that increases each frame the key is pressed
  pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- cube.scale.x + t] W !pressUp(e);
}
```

Explanation:
- The `always assume` block ensures that either the `pressUp(e)` is true (key is pressed) or false (key is not pressed).
- The `always guarantee` block specifies that when the up key is not pressed, the cube's scale (x-axis) is reset to 0.5. When the up key is pressed, the cube's scale x value increments by a counter `t` (which increments every frame) until the key is released.
