Here is the TSL specification based on the provided description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Define the behavior of pressing the up key
  pressUp(e);
}

always guarantee {
  // When the up key is not pressed, set the scale of the cube along the x-axis to 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- 0.5];

  // When the up key is pressed, incrementally update the cube's scale along the x-axis according to a counter 't' that increases each frame
  pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- t];

  // When the key is released, the scale value immediately returns to 0.5
  // This is implicitly covered by the first rule when the key is not pressed
}
``` 

This specification ensures that the cube's scale is responsive to the user's input on the up key, increasing when the key is pressed and resetting when it is released.
