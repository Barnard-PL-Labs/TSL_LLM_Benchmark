Here's how to translate your natural language description into a TSL specification:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Detects whether the up key is pressed
  pressUp(e);
}

always guarantee {
  // When the up key is pressed, increment the scale along the x-axis
  pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- t];

  // When the up key is not pressed, reset the scale along the x-axis to 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- 0.5];
}
```
