Here is the TSL specification based on your description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // The state of pressing the up key is handled by the environment and is either true or false
}

always guarantee {
  // When the up key is not pressed, the cube's scale along x-axis should be set to 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- 0.5];

  // When the up key is pressed, increment the cube's x-axis scale by a counter that increments each frame the key is pressed
  pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- cube.scale.x + delta];
}
```

In this specification:

1. **Assumptions** are left empty because the pressing of the up key is a simple true or false state handled by external input (event listener for key press).

2. **Guarantees** contain commands for setting the cube's scale:
   - When the up key is not pressed, the scale along the x-axis is set to a constant value of 0.5.
   - When the up key is pressed, the scale along the x-axis increments by a variable `delta` which represents the change per frame while the key remains pressed. This `delta` could be predefined or calculated based on additional parameters like frame rate. If exact behavior on how `delta` should be accumulated isn't specified in your tools or requirements, this might be a placeholder for a more complex function.

This model assumes the presence of a mechanism to capture real-time keypress events and continuous updating of the cube's scale while the key is held down, resetting immediately when the key is released.
