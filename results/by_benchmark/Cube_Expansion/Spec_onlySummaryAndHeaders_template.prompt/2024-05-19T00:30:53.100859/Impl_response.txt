To implement the predicate `pressUp(e)` in JavaScript that checks if the user presses the up arrow key on their keyboard, you can utilize the browser's event handling system to detect the `keydown` event and determine whether the pressed key is the up arrow key. Below is the implementation using an event listener:

```javascript
// Define a variable to track the state of the up arrow key
let isUpArrowPressed = false;

// Function to check if the up arrow key is pressed
function checkUpArrowKey(event) {
    // Update the isUpArrowPressed state based on whether the up arrow key is pressed
    if (event.keyCode === 38) {  // 38 is the key code for the up arrow key
        isUpArrowPressed = true;
    }
    if (event.type === 'keyup' && event.keyCode === 38) {
        isUpArrowPressed = false;
    }
}

// Add event listeners to the document to listen for keydown and keyup events
document.addEventListener('keydown', checkUpArrowKey);
document.addEventListener('keyup', checkUpArrowKey);

// Predicate function to get the state of the up arrow key
function pressUp() {
    return isUpArrowPressed;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Variable Initialization**:
   - `isUpArrowPressed`: A boolean variable initialized to `false`. It will track whether the up arrow key is currently pressed.

2. **Event Handling Functions**:
   - `checkUpArrowKey()`: This function is triggered on `keydown` and `keyup` events. It checks if the event's `keyCode` is `38` (the code for the up arrow key). If it's a `keydown` event for the up arrow key, `isUpArrowPressed` is set to `true`. If it's a `keyup` event for the up arrow key, `isUpArrowPressed` is set to `false`.

3. **Event Listeners**:
   - The `document.addEventListener` calls attach the `checkUpArrowKey` function as a handler for both `keydown` and `keyup` events. This allows the script to update the state of `isUpArrowPressed` when the up arrow key is pressed or released.

4. **Predicate Function**:
   - `pressUp()`: This function simply returns the current value of `isUpArrowPressed`, indicating whether the up arrow key is currently pressed. This function can be used wherever a boolean indicator is needed to check the state of the up arrow key, fitting the requirement of a predicate.

This implementation ensures that `pressUp()` will accurately reflect the state of the up arrow key, providing a boolean output as required.
