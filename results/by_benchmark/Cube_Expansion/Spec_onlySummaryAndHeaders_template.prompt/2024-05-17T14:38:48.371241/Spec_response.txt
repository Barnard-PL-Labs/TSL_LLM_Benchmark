Here is the TSL specification based on the given description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensures that the pressUp(e) is correctly detected as either true or false
  pressUp(e) || !pressUp(e);
}

always guarantee {
  // When the up key is not pressed, the cube's scale along the x-axis is set to 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- 0.5];

  // When the up key is pressed, increment the cube's scale along the x-axis by t, where t increments each frame
  pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- cube.scale.x + t];

  // Ensure that the value of cube.scale.x is reset to 0.5 once the up key is released
  (!pressUp(e) W pressUp(e)) -> [cube.scale.x <- 0.5];
}
```

In this specification:
- The `assume` section declares that the `pressUp(e)` predicate can correctly identify when the up key is being pressed and when it is not.
- The `guarantee` section sets the scale of the cube along the x-axis to 0.5 when the up key is not pressed. It ensures that when the up key is pressed, the cube's scale along the x-axis increases incrementally with each frame. The scale is reset to 0.5 when the up key is released, ensuring the cube reacts immediately to the change in the key press state.
