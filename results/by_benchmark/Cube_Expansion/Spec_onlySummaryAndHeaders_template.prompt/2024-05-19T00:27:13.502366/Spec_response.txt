Based on the given description, here is how you can translate the scenario into a TSL specification:

```
always assume {
  // We assume that pressUp(e) is properly defined and reacts to the user's input
}

always guarantee {
  // When up key is not pressed, the cube's scale along the x-axis remains at 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- 0.5];

  // When up key is pressed, increment the value of cube.scale.x each frame
  pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- cube.scale.x + 0.1];
}
```

This specification ensures that:
- The cube's x-axis scale is set to 0.5 whenever the up key is not being pressed.
- When the up key is pressed, the x-axis scale of the cube is incrementally increased by 0.1 for each frame during which the key remains pressed.
