Here is the TSL template for the described scenario:

```tsl
always assume {
  // States that the up key is either pressed or not pressed
  pressUp(e) || !pressUp(e);
}

always guarantee {
  // When the up key is not pressed, the scale of the cube on the x-axis should be 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- 0.5];
  
  // When the up key is pressed, incrementally increase the scale value as long as the key is pressed
  pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- t] W !pressUp(e);
}
```

Explanation:

1. **Assumptions:**
   - The system assumes two possible states of the predicate `pressUp(e)`: either it is true (the up key is pressed) or false (the up key is not pressed).

2. **Guarantees:**
   - If the up key is not pressed (`!pressUp(e)`), the cube's x-axis scale is set to 0.5.
   - If the up key is pressed (`pressUp(e)`), the cube’s scale along the x-axis increases incrementally (`cube.scale.x <- t`). This scaling continues until the key is released. The temporal operator `W` (weak until) is used, which ensures that the cube’s scale is maintained or changed only when the `pressUp(e)` predicate is false, reflecting the key release.
