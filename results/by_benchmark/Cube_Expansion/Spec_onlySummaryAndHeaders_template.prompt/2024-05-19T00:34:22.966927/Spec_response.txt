Here's how you can translate the provided natural language description into a TSL specification:

```tsl
always assume {
  // pressUp(e) is true when the up key is pressed, handled via an event listener for keydown events
}

always guarantee {
  // When the up key is pressed, increment the scale.x value of the cube each frame
  // When the up key is not pressed, reset the scale.x value of the cube to 0.5
  pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- cube.scale.x + 0.1];
  !pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- 0.5];
}
```

In this TSL specification:
- The `always assume` block is left empty as the pressing of the up key is a direct predicate without additional assumptions needed.
- The `always guarantee` block specifies the behavior of the cubeâ€™s scale along the x-axis:
  - When `pressUp(e)` is true, indicating the up key is pressed, the scale on the x-axis of the cube increases by 0.1 each frame.
  - When `pressUp(e)` is not true, indicating the up key is not pressed, the scale on the x-axis is immediately set back to 0.5.
