To implement the predicate `pressUp(e)` in JavaScript, you'll need to add an event listener for the "keydown" event to check if the user presses the up arrow key on their keyboard. The predicate will return `true` when the up arrow key is pressed and `false` otherwise. Here's how you can achieve this within the JavaScript environment:

```javascript
// Initialize a variable to store the state of the up arrow key
let upArrowPressed = false;

// Add an event listener to the window to listen for keydown events
window.addEventListener('keydown', function(e) {
    // Check if the pressed key is the up arrow key (keyCode 38)
    if (e.keyCode === 38) {
        upArrowPressed = true;
    }
});

// Add an event listener to the window to listen for keyup events
window.addEventListener('keyup', function(e) {
    // Check if the released key is the up arrow key (keyCode 38)
    if (e.keyCode === 38) {
        upArrowPressed = false;
    }
});

// Define the pressUp predicate function
function pressUp() {
    return upArrowPressed;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Variable Initialization**: `upArrowPressed` is a Boolean variable initialized to `false`. It acts as a flag to indicate whether the up arrow key is currently pressed.

2. **Event Listeners**:
   - **Keydown Event**: When a key is pressed, the `keydown` event is triggered. Inside this event listener, the function checks if the key code corresponds to the up arrow key (code 38). If it does, `upArrowPressed` is set to `true`.
   - **Keyup Event**: Similarly, when a key is released, the `keyup` event is triggered. The function again checks for the up arrow key and resets `upArrowPressed` to `false` if this key is released.

3. **Predicate Function (`pressUp`)**: This function returns the current state of the `upArrowPressed` flag, thereby indicating if the up arrow key is pressed (`true`) or not (`false`).

This implementation allows you to check at any point in your application whether the up arrow key is currently being pressed by calling the `pressUp()` function. This method does not directly manipulate or listen to changes on `cube.scale.x` as per the provided API, since the task specified only to implement the predicate for the keyboard event.
