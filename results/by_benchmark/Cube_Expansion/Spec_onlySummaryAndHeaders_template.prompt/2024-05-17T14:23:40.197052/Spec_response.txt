Here is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description and functions:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Define the exclusive nature of the pressUp event
  true; // No specific assumptions are required beyond basic event handling
}

always guarantee {
  // When the up key is not pressed, the cube's x-axis scale is set to 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- 0.5];

  // When the up key is pressed, the cube's x-axis scale increments based on a counter that increases each frame the key is pressed
  pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- cube.scale.x + 0.1] W !pressUp(e);
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Assumptions**: The `always assume` block is empty (with a placeholder `true` statement) as the scenario doesn't require complex assumptions about the system's environment or interactions. 

2. **Guarantees**:
    - When the up key is not pressed (`!pressUp(e)`), the cube's scale along the x-axis (`cube.scale.x`) is set to `0.5`.
    - When the up key is pressed (`pressUp(e)`), there is an ongoing update to `cube.scale.x` where it increments by `0.1` each frame. This continues until the up key is released (`!pressUp(e)`), using the weak until (`W`) to handle the transition back to the initial scale when the key is released.

This TSL specification directly maps the behavior of the cube's scaling in response to user input, adhering to the natural language description provided.
