To address the requirement of implementing predicates using the provided API, specifically the ability to detect when the up arrow key is pressed, the implementation would require setting up an event listener for keyboard events and a mechanism to track the state of the up arrow key. Below is the JavaScript code to implement this functionality.

### Predicate Implementation in JavaScript

```javascript
// This object will store the state of the keys
const keyState = {
    upPressed: false
};

// Adding an event listener to the document to listen for 'keydown' and 'keyup' events
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
    if (event.key === "ArrowUp") {
        keyState.upPressed = true;
    }
});

document.addEventListener('keyup', function(event) {
    if (event.key === "ArrowUp") {
        keyState.upPressed = false;
    }
});

// Predicate function to check if the up arrow key is pressed
function pressUp() {
    return keyState.upPressed;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Key State Tracking**: A `keyState` object is used to keep track of whether the up arrow key is currently pressed. It initializes `upPressed` as `false`.

2. **Event Listeners**:
   - **Keydown Listener**: When the 'keydown' event is detected, the function checks if the `event.key` is `"ArrowUp"`. If true, it sets `keyState.upPressed` to `true`, indicating the up arrow key is pressed.
   - **Keyup Listener**: Similar to the 'keydown' listener, but it sets `keyState.upPressed` to `false` when the up arrow key is released.

3. **Predicate Function (`pressUp`)**: This function returns the current state of `upPressed` from the `keyState` object. It returns `true` if the up arrow key is currently pressed, otherwise `false`.

This setup ensures that any component or system that needs to check if the up arrow key is pressed can simply call the `pressUp()` function, which will accurately return the current state based on real-time user input. This approach adheres to the requirements and constraints specified, relying solely on predicates without implementing additional functions beyond the necessary event management and state tracking.
