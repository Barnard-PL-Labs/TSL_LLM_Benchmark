Here's the TSL specification based on the natural language description provided:

```tsl
always assume {
  // We assume either the up key is pressed or not pressed
}

always guarantee {
  // When the up key is not pressed, set the scale of the cube along the x-axis to 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- 0.5];

  // When the up key is pressed, increment the scale of the cube along the x-axis each frame
  pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- cube.scale.x + 0.01];
}
```

This TSL code respects the condition that the cube's scale should start at 0.5 when the up key is not pressed and increment continually while the up key remains pressed. When the key is released, the scale immediately resets to 0.5.
