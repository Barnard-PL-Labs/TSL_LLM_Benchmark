To translate the given natural language description into a TSL specification, we need to detail how the scale of the cube along the x-axis (cube.scale.x) behaves based on the user input from the up key. Here's the TSL template:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Assume that pressing and releasing the up key are mutually exclusive events each frame
  !(pressUp(e) && !pressUp(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // When the up key is pressed, incrementally update cube.scale.x
  pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- cube.scale.x + 0.1];

  // When the up key is not pressed, reset cube.scale.x to 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- 0.5];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions**:
   - We assume that pressing and not pressing the up key cannot occur at the same time.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - When the `pressUp(e)` predicate is true (i.e., the user presses the up key), the cube's scale along the x-axis (`cube.scale.x`) is incremented by 0.1 each frame.
   - When the `pressUp(e)` predicate is false (i.e., the user is not pressing the up key), the cube's scale along the x-axis is reset to 0.5.

This TSL specification captures the dynamic behavior of the cube's scale based on user interaction with the up key, adhering to the provided natural language description.
