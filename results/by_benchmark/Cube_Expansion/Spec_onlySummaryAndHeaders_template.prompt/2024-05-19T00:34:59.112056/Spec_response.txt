Here's the TSL specification that represents the natural language description provided:

```tsl
always assume {
  // No specific assumptions related to external conditions are necessary
}

always guarantee {
  // When the up key is not pressed, the cube's scale along the x-axis remains at 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- 0.5];

  // When the up key is pressed, the cube's scale along the x-axis increases incrementally each frame
  pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- cube.scale.x + 0.1];
}
```
