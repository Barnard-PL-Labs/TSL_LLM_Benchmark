Here is the TSL specification based on the provided description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // pressUp(e) already defined as per the description
}

always guarantee {
  // When the up key is not pressed, cube's scale along the x-axis is set to 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- 0.5];

  // When the up key is pressed, increment the scale value each frame
  pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- cube.scale.x + 0.1];
}
```
