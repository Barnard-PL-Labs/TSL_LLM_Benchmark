To implement the predicate `pressUp(e)` in JavaScript, which checks if the user presses the up arrow key on their keyboard, we need to set up an event listener that listens for the `keydown` event and checks if the pressed key is the up arrow key. Below is the code to implement this predicate.

First, we need to assume that the environment where this code runs provides us access to the `document` object to add event listeners. Here's how you can implement it:

```javascript
// Variable to hold the state of the up arrow key
let isUpKeyPressed = false;

// Add event listener to document for 'keydown' event
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
    // Check if the key pressed is the up arrow key
    if (event.key === 'ArrowUp') {
        isUpKeyPressed = true;
    }
});

// Add event listener to document for 'keyup' event
document.addEventListener('keyup', function(event) {
    // Check if the key released is the up arrow key
    if (event.key === 'ArrowUp') {
        isUpKeyPressed = false;
    }
});

// Predicate function to check if the up arrow key is pressed
function pressUp() {
    return isUpKeyPressed;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Event Listeners**: The code adds two event listeners to the `document` object. One listens for `keydown` events and the other for `keyup` events.
- **Key Check**: Inside each event listener, the function checks if the key involved in the event is the up arrow key (`'ArrowUp'`).
- **State Management**: A variable `isUpKeyPressed` is used to maintain the state of the up arrow key. It is set to `true` when the up arrow key is pressed down and set back to `false` when the key is released.
- **Predicate Function `pressUp`**: This function returns the current state of the up arrow key (i.e., whether it is currently pressed or not).

This implementation allows any part of the system to call `pressUp()` at any time to check if the up arrow key is currently pressed, integrating smoothly with the rest of the system that might rely on this predicate for processing user input in real-time.
