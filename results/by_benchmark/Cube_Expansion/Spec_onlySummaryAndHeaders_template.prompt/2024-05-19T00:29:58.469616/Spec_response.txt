Here's the TSL specification based on the natural language description provided:

```tsl
always assume {
  // The predicate pressUp(e) indicates whether the up key is pressed. This is an input from the environment.
}

always guarantee {
  // When the up key is not pressed, the cube's scale.x is set to 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- 0.5];

  // When the up key is pressed, increment the scale value of the cube along the x-axis by t, where t increases each frame the key is pressed.
  pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- cube.scale.x + t];

  // When the up key is released, the scale value immediately returns to 0.5
  // This is implicitly handled by the first rule
}
```

In this specification:
- The `always assume` block listens for the `pressUp(e)` predicate, which reflects whether the up arrow key is being pressed.
- The `always guarantee` block contains the logic for adjusting the `cube.scale.x` based on whether `pressUp(e)` is true or false. When not pressed, it ensures the scale is set to 0.5. When pressed, it increments the scale by `t` each frame, where `t` could be defined elsewhere in your system to increment each frame (note that `t` needs proper definition in the context of the system for this rule to work correctly).
