To implement the predicate `pressUp(e)` in JavaScript, which checks if the user presses the up arrow key on their keyboard, we'll need to add an appropriate event listener to the window object that listens for the `keydown` event. This predicate will change its truth value based on whether the up arrow key (which has a keycode of 38) is pressed.

Here's a basic implementation:

```javascript
// Define a variable to track the state of the up arrow key
let isUpArrowPressed = false;

// Add an event listener to track when the up arrow key is pressed down
window.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
    if (event.keyCode === 38) {  // 38 is the keycode for the up arrow key
        isUpArrowPressed = true;
    }
});

// Add an event listener to track when the up arrow key is released
window.addEventListener('keyup', function(event) {
    if (event.keyCode === 38) {
        isUpArrowPressed = false;
    }
});

// Predicate function to check if the up arrow key is pressed
function pressUp() {
    return isUpArrowPressed;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Variable Declaration**: `isUpArrowPressed` is a boolean variable initialized to `false`. It helps track whether the up arrow key is currently pressed.

2. **Event Listeners**:
   - The `keydown` event listener sets `isUpArrowPressed` to `true` when the up arrow key is pressed.
   - The `keyup` event listener sets `isUpArrowPressed` to `false` when the up arrow key is released.

3. **Predicate Function `pressUp`**:
   - This function returns the current state of `isUpArrowPressed`, allowing other parts of your system to understand whether the up arrow key is actively being pressed.

This setup ensures that the `pressUp` predicate accurately reflects the state of the up arrow key at any given time.
