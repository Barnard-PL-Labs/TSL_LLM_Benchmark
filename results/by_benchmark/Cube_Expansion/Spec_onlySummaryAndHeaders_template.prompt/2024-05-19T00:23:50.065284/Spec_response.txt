Here is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Pressing and releasing the up key are mutually exclusive events.
  !(pressUp(e) && !pressUp(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // When the up key is not pressed, set the scale of the cube along the x-axis to 0.5.
  !pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- 0.5];
  
  // When the up key is pressed, increment the scale of the cube along the x-axis by t (where t increments over time while the key is pressed).
  pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- 0.5 + t];
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Assumptions**:
   - I included an assumption that pressing and not pressing the up key are mutually exclusive to explicitly handle the state of the key press. This ensures there's a clear transition between the key press states.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - When the up key is not pressed, the cubeâ€™s scale along the x-axis is set to `0.5`.
   - When the up key is pressed, the guarantee ensures that the scale of the cube along the x-axis increases incrementally based on a cumulative time `t` that the key remains pressed, starting from the baseline `0.5`. 

This TSL specification captures the continuous and dynamic adjustment of the cube's scale in response to pressing the up key and ensures it resets when the key is not pressed.
