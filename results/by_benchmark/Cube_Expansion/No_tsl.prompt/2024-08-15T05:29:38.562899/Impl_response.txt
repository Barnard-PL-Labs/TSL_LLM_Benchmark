To implement the function `updateState` in JavaScript based on the natural language description provided, we need to ensure that the cube's scale along the x-axis reacts to the pressing of the up key as described. Here is the implementation:

```javascript
// State tracking variables
let count = 0.5;
let isKeyUp = true;

// Function to handle key press events
function handleKeyPress(event) {
    if (event.key === "ArrowUp") {
        isKeyUp = false;
    }
}

// Function to handle key release events
function handleKeyRelease(event) {
    if (event.key === "ArrowUp") {
        isKeyUp = true;
        count = 0.5; // Reset count when key is released
    }
}

// Event listeners for key presses and releases
document.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyPress);
document.addEventListener('keyup', handleKeyRelease);

/**
 * The updateState function updates and returns the state of the cube based on user input.
 * @param {object} state - The current state of the system, including the cube's scale.
 */
function updateState(state) {
    // Increment the count if the up key is pressed
    if (!isKeyUp) {
        count += 1;
    }
    
    // Update the cube's scale.x based on the count
    state.cube.scale.x = count;
    
    // Return the updated state
    return state;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Event Listeners**: The `handleKeyPress` and `handleKeyRelease` functions are used to track when the 'ArrowUp' key is pressed and released, respectively. The `isKeyUp` flag is used to detect the current state of the key (pressed or not pressed).

2. **Initial State of Count**: The `count` variable holds the scale value for the cube along the x-axis. It is initialized to 0.5. When the key is pressed, this value is incremented by 1 every time the `updateState` function is called, simulating an update every frame.

3. **Resetting the Count**: When the 'ArrowUp' key is released, the `count` is reset to 0.5, and the `isKeyUp` flag is set to true.

4. **Updating the State**: The `updateState` function is called (presumably every frame) to update the scale of the cube based on the current value of `count`. The updated state is then returned.

This implementation assumes that the `updateState` function is called in a loop or similar repetitive mechanism, allowing it to modify the cube's scale.x value every frame based on the key press state. Adjustments might be needed based on the specific framework or environment in which this function is used.
