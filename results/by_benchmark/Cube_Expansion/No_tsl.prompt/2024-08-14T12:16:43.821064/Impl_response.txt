To implement the described functionality in JavaScript, you'll need to manage the state changes based on user input (specifically the pressing of the up arrow key), and also handle the increment of a counter while the key is pressed. This involves setting up an event listener for key presses and releases, and updating the cube's scale accordingly.

Below is the JavaScript implementation based on the description provided:

```javascript
function setupCubeScaleInteraction() {
    let count = 0.5; // Initial value of the counter when the up key is not pressed
    let isUpKeyPressed = false; // State to track if the up key is pressed

    // Function to update the scale of the cube based on the current count
    function updateCubeScale() {
        cube.scale.x = count;
    }

    // Event listener for keydown to detect when the up key is pressed
    document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
        if (event.key === 'ArrowUp') {
            isUpKeyPressed = true;
        }
    });

    // Event listener for keyup to detect when the up key is released
    document.addEventListener('keyup', function(event) {
        if (event.key === 'ArrowUp') {
            isUpKeyPressed = false;
            count = 0.5; // Reset count to initial value when key is released
            updateCubeScale(); // Update the cube scale immediately when the key is released
        }
    });

    // Animation frame loop to handle the increment of the counter
    function animate() {
        if (isUpKeyPressed) {
            count += 1; // Increment count by 1 every frame if the up key is pressed
            updateCubeScale(); // Update the cube scale with the new count value
        }
        requestAnimationFrame(animate); // Continue the loop
    }

    animate(); // Start the animation loop
}

// Example usage
let cube = { scale: { x: 0.5 } }; // Mock a cube object
setupCubeScaleInteraction(); // Setup interaction and start listening for key events
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initial State**: We start with `count` initialized to 0.5 to represent the cube's scale along the x-axis when the up key is not pressed.

2. **Event Listeners**:
   - The `keydown` event sets the `isUpKeyPressed` flag to true and starts increasing the counter if the up arrow key is pressed.
   - The `keyup` event checks if it was the up arrow that was released, resets the `count` to 0.5, and updates the scale immediately.

3. **Animation Loop**:
   - The function `animate` uses `requestAnimationFrame` to create an ongoing loop.
   - Inside the loop, if the up key is pressed, the counter is incremented by 1 on each frame, and the cube's scale is updated accordingly.

4. **Scale Update**: The cube's scale along the x-axis is modified through the function `updateCubeScale`, which sets `cube.scale.x` to the current `count`.

This setup assumes that the cube object and its properties (`cube.scale.x`) are accessible and modifiable as described. Adjustments may be needed depending on the actual environment and framework you are working with.
