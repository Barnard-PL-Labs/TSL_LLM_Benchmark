To implement the described behavior in JavaScript, we need to handle the cube's scaling based on the pressing or releasing of the up arrow key. We'll use an event listener to track when the up key is pressed and released. We'll also use a continuous update mechanism to change the cube's scale when the key is pressed. Here's how you can create and define the `updateState` function:

```javascript
// Define the initial state variables
let cube = { scale: { x: 0.5 } };
let isUpPressed = false;
let count = 0.5;

// Event listeners for key down and key up events
document.addEventListener('keydown', (event) => {
  if (event.key === "ArrowUp") {
    isUpPressed = true;
  }
});

document.addEventListener('keyup', (event) => {
  if (event.key === "ArrowUp") {
    isUpPressed = false;
    count = 0.5; // Reset count to 0.5 when the key is released
  }
});

// Function to update the cube's state
function updateState() {
  if (isUpPressed) {
    count += 1; // Increment count each frame when the up key is pressed
  } else {
    count = 0.5; // Maintain count at 0.5 when the up key is not pressed
  }
  
  cube.scale.x = count; // Update the cube's scale x with the value of count
  
  return {
    currentState: cube,
    count: count
  };
}

// A function to continuously update the state at a certain time interval
function animate() {
  updateState();
  requestAnimationFrame(animate); // Continue updating in sync with the browser's refresh rate
}

// Start the animation function
animate();
```

### Explanation

1. **Event Listeners**: Two event listeners track the pressing (`keydown`) and releasing (`keyup`) of the up arrow key. These modify the `isUpPressed` boolean flag accordingly.

2. **updateState Function**: This function checks if the up key is pressed. If it is, it increments the `count` which represents how long the key has been held down. If the key is not pressed, it resets the `count` to 0.5. It then updates the cube's x-axis scale with this count and returns the current state.

3. **Continuous Update Loop**: The `animate` function calls `updateState` in a loop using `requestAnimationFrame`, which ensures that the cube's state is updated in sync with the browser's repaint rate. This is necessary to continuously increment the counter while the key is pressed.

This setup aligns with the guarantees that the scale should increment while the key is pressed and reset when it's not, using real-time input from the keyboard.
