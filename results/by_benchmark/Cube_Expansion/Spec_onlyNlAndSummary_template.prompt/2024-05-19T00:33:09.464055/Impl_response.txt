To build this setup using TSL (Temporal Stream Logic) and JavaScript, we would need to ensure that JavaScript is handling the event-driven parts, such as detecting key presses. Below, I'll provide a TSL template and the necessary JavaScript code to integrate with the system API for handling the `pressUp` predicate.

### TSL Template Implementation

For the TSL part, we define the environment interaction and the system's guarantee based on the `pressUp` predicate:

```tsl
always assume {
}

always guarantee {
    pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- 1.5];
    !pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- 1.0];
}
```

This TSL template specifies that when the up arrow key is pressed (`pressUp(e)` returns true), the cube's x-axis scale should increase to 1.5. When the up arrow key is not pressed, the cube's x-axis scale should return to 1.0.

### JavaScript Integration

To implement the `pressUp` predicate in JavaScript and to integrate it with the cube scaling, we would use event listeners to detect key presses. Here's how you might set that up:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
    if (event.key === 'ArrowUp') {
        cube.scale.x = 1.5;
    }
});

document.addEventListener('keyup', function(event) {
    if (event.key === 'ArrowUp') {
        cube.scale.x = 1.0;
    }
});
```

### Explanation

1. **JavaScript Event Listeners:** The `keydown` event listener checks for the 'ArrowUp' key, and if it's pressed, the cube's scale on the x-axis is set to 1.5. The `keyup` event sets the scale back to 1.0 when the 'ArrowUp' key is released.

2. **TSL Guarantees:** The TSL template reflects these changes by adjusting the scale based on the predicate `pressUp(e)`. The system guarantees that the cube's scale changes are correctly represented and managed over time based on the user input.

This setup combines both TSL for defining temporal guarantees and JavaScript for implementing the event-driven logic, with changes affecting a graphical element like a cube in a 3D environment.
