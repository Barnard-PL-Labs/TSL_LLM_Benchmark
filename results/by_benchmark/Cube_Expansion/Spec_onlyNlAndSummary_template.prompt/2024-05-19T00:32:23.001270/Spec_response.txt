Here's the translation of your natural language description into a TSL specification for the behavior of a cube's scale in response to user input:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Define the environment's input: whether the up key is being pressed or not
  (pressUp || !pressUp);
}

always guarantee {
  // When the up button is pressed, increment the counter (count) by 1 each frame
  pressUp -> [count <- count + 1];

  // When the up button is not pressed, reset the counter (count) to 0.5
  !pressUp -> [count <- 0.5];

  // The scale value along the x-axis (cube.scale.x) is eventually updated to the value of the counter (count)
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions**: We assume that the input can be either pressing the up key or not pressing it. This is implicit in the way inputs are usually defined in TSL. 

2. **Guarantees**: 
   - When the "up" key is pressed (`pressUp`), the count is incremented by 1 each frame. This is represented by `[count <- count + 1]`.
   - When the "up" key is not pressed (`!pressUp`), the count is reset to 0.5 immediately. This is represented by `[count <- 0.5]`.
   - Independently of the key press state, the cube's x-axis scale (`cube.scale.x`) is set to the current value of `count`. This ensures that the cube's scale updates continuously according to the last definition of count.

This TSL specification provides a clear description of how the cube's scale should react based on the user's interaction with the up key, capturing both the changes over time and the immediate reset when the key is not pressed.
