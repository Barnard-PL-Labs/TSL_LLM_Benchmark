```tsl
always assume {
  // There is no conflicting input that would contradict the up button state
}

always guarantee {
  // When the user presses the up button, increment the counter (count) by 1 every frame
  pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

  // When the user is not pressing the up button, the counter (count) remains at 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];

  // The scale value along the x-axis (cube.scale.x) is updated with the value of the counter (count)
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
