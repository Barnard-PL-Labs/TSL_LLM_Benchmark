To implement the predicate `pressUp(e)` using the provided system API and JavaScript, we will need to add an event listener to listen for the `keydown` events on the `document`. The predicate will check if the pressed key is the up arrow key.

Here's how you can implement this predicate:

```javascript
// Variable to track the state of up arrow key press
let isUpKeyPressed = false;

// Function to update the isUpKeyPressed based on keydown events
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
    if (event.key === 'ArrowUp') {
        isUpKeyPressed = true;
    }
});

// Function to update the isUpKeyPressed based on keyup events
document.addEventListener('keyup', function(event) {
    if (event.key === 'ArrowUp') {
        isUpKeyPressed = false;
    }
});

// Predicate function to check if the up arrow key is pressed
function pressUp() {
    return isUpKeyPressed;
}
```

### Explanations:
1. **Variable Declaration**: `isUpKeyPressed` is a boolean variable initialized to `false`. It tracks whether the up arrow key is currently pressed.

2. **Event Listener for `keydown`**: This event listener checks if the key pressed is the up arrow key (`ArrowUp`). If it is, `isUpKeyPressed` is set to `true`.

3. **Event Listener for `keyup`**: This listener checks if the up arrow key is released. If the released key is the up arrow key, `isUpKeyPressed` is set back to `false`.

4. **Predicate Function `pressUp`**: This function returns the current state of `isUpKeyPressed`, indicating whether the up arrow key is currently pressed (`true`) or not (`false`).

This implementation efficiently tracks and updates the state of the up arrow key press, allowing the `pressUp` predicate to accurately reflect the key's current state. The use of the `keyup` event ensures that the key press state is correctly reset when the key is released, avoiding issues where the key press state might otherwise "stick" incorrectly.

This function can later be used within any system that needs to know if the up arrow key is currently being pressed, such as for controlling movement in a game or for navigating in a UI.
