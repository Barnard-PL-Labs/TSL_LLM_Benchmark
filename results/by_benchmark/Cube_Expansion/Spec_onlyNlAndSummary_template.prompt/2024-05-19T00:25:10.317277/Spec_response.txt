Here's a TSL specification based on the provided natural language description:

```TSL
always assume {
  // Mutual exclusion between pressing and not pressing the up key
  !(pressUp && !pressUp);
}

always guarantee {
  // When the up button is pressed, increment the counter each frame
  pressUp -> ([count <- count + 1]) W !pressUp;
  
  // When the up button is not pressed, reset the counter to 0.5
  !pressUp -> [count <- 0.5];
  
  // Update the cube's scale along the x-axis with the value of the counter
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Assumptions**: I have assumed a mutual exclusion between the state of pressing and not pressing the up key. This helps to make sure that the logic does not assume both can happen at the same time, which is physically impossible.
  
- **Guarantees**: 
  1. When the up key is pressed (`pressUp`), the counter (`count`) is incremented by 1 each frame until the up key is no longer pressed. This is represented by a weak until (`W`) condition: the incrementing happens while the up key is pressed, and stops when it is not.
  2. When the up key is not pressed (`!pressUp`), the counter is immediately set to 0.5.
  3. The cube's scale along the x-axis (`cube.scale.x`) is always set to the current value of `count`, ensuring the scale is updated accordingly.

This TSL specification reflects the behavior described where the cube reacts to the up key by changing its scale based on a counter that increments while the key is pressed and resets when the key is released.
