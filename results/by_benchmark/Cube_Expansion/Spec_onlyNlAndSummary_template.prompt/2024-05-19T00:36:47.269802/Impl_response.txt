To implement the specified predicate function `pressUp(e)` using JavaScript, we will need to listen for `keydown` events on the entire document. This function will determine if the `up arrow key` (which has a keyCode of 38) is pressed. We'll structure our code to set up an event listener for the `keydown` event and update a state variable that tracks whether the `up arrow key` is currently pressed. Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
// Predicate state - initially, the up key is not pressed.
let isUpKeyPressed = false;

// Function to check if the up arrow key is pressed
function checkUpKeyPress(event) {
  // Update the state when the up arrow key is pressed
  if (event.keyCode === 38) {
    isUpKeyPressed = true;
  }
}

// Function to reset the key press state when the key is released
function resetUpKeyPress(event) {
  // Reset the state when the up arrow key is released
  if (event.keyCode === 38) {
    isUpKeyPressed = false;
  }
}

// Add event listeners for keydown and keyup
document.addEventListener('keydown', checkUpKeyPress);
document.addEventListener('keyup', resetUpKeyPress);

// Predicate function to return the current state of the up key
function pressUp() {
  return isUpKeyPressed;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **State Variable**: `isUpKeyPressed` is used to maintain the state of the up arrow key. It is initially set to `false`.

2. **checkUpKeyPress Function**: This function updates `isUpKeyPressed` to `true` when the up arrow key (keyCode 38) is pressed. It's attached to the `keydown` event.

3. **resetUpKeyPress Function**: This function resets `isUpKeyPressed` to `false` when the up arrow key is released. This ensures that the predicate only returns `true` while the key is actively pressed. It's attached to the `keyup` event.

4. **Event Listeners**: We attach `checkUpKeyPress` to the `keydown` event and `resetUpKeyPress` to the `keyup` event on the `document`. This ensures that key presses are captured no matter where the focus is on the page.

5. **pressUp Function**: This is the predicate function that returns the current state of `isUpKeyPressed`. It allows other parts of the system to check if the up arrow key is currently pressed.

This setup ensures that `pressUp()` accurately reflects whether the up arrow key is pressed at any given time by keeping track of keydown and keyup events.
