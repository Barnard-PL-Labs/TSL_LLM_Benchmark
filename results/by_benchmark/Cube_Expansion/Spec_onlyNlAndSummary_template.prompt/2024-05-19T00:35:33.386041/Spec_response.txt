Here's the TSL specification based on the given natural language description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Assumption block empty as specific assumptions about the environment other than the key press are not mentioned
}

always guarantee {
  // When the up button is pressed, increment the counter each frame
  pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];
  
  // When the up button is not pressed, reset the counter to 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];
  
  // The cube's scale along the x-axis is updated to the value of the counter
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

### Explanation of the TSL Specification:

- **Assumptions:** The `always assume` block is left empty because the problem description does not provide explicit environmental conditions or interactions that must be assumed other than the button press.

- **Guarantees:**
  1. **Incrementing the Counter**: When the user presses the up button (`pressUp(e)`), the counter `count` is incremented by 1 every frame. This is handled by the assignment `[count <- count + 1]`.
  
  2. **Resetting the Counter**: When the up button is not pressed (`!pressUp(e)`), the counter `count` is reset to 0.5. This ensures that the cube's scale on the x-axis reduces to its initial state when the button is not being pressed.
  
  3. **Updating the Cubeâ€™s Scale**: Regardless of the button state, the cube's scale along the x-axis (`cube.scale.x`) is continuously updated to match the current value of `count`. This allows the scale change to reflect the duration for which the button is pressed, increasing as long as the button is held down and resetting when released.
