Here's the TSL specification based on the natural language description provided:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Define how the up key interaction is assumed to work
  (pressUp(e) && !pressUp(e')) -> X !pressUp(e);
  (!pressUp(e) && pressUp(e')) -> X pressUp(e);
}

always guarantee {
  // Increment the counter each frame while the up key is pressed
  pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

  // Reset the counter to 0.5 when the up key is not pressed
  !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];

  // Update the cube's x-axis scale with the counter value
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Assumptions**:
   - If the up key is pressed and then released the very next moment, the next state should not detect the up key as pressed.
   - If the up key is not pressed and is pressed the very next moment, the next state should detect the up key as pressed.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - When the user presses the up button, the counter increments by 1 for every frame during which the key remains pressed.
   - When the user is not pressing the up button, the counter is set to 0.5.
   - The scale of the cube along the x-axis (`cube.scale.x`) is continuously updated to match the current count value.

This TSL specification ensures that the cube's scaling behavior reacts dynamically and precisely to the user's interaction with the up key, reflecting changes in real-time.
