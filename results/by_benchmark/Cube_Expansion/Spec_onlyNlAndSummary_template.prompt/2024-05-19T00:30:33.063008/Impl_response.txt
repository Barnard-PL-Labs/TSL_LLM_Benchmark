To implement the `pressUp(e)` predicate as specified, we can use JavaScript to add an event listener to the document that listens for the 'keydown' event. This event triggers every time a key is pressed down. To determine if the "up arrow key" specifically is pressed, we can check if the key code (or key) of the event corresponds to the up arrow key, which is generally represented by the key code `38` or the key value `"ArrowUp"`.

Here is how you can implement it in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Variable to keep track of whether the up arrow key is currently pressed
let upKeyPressed = false;

// Function to set upKeyPressed to true when the up arrow key is pressed
function checkPressUp(event) {
    if (event.keyCode === 38 || event.key === "ArrowUp") {
        upKeyPressed = true;
    }
}

// Function to reset upKeyPressed to false when any key is released
function resetPressUp(event) {
    if (event.keyCode === 38 || event.key === "ArrowUp") {
        upKeyPressed = false;
    }
}

// Add event listeners to the document for keydown and keyup events
document.addEventListener('keydown', checkPressUp);
document.addEventListener('keyup', resetPressUp);

// Predicate function to check if the up arrow key is pressed
function pressUp() {
    return upKeyPressed;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Variable Declaration:**
   - `upKeyPressed`: A boolean variable that stores the state of the up arrow key, whether it's currently pressed or not.

2. **Function `checkPressUp`:**
   - This function is triggered on the 'keydown' event.
   - It checks if the key pressed is the up arrow key. If it is, `upKeyPressed` is set to true.

3. **Function `resetPressUp`:**
   - This function is triggered on the 'keyup' event.
   - It checks if the key released is the up arrow key. If it is, `upKeyPressed` is set back to false.

4. **Event Listeners:**
   - Two event listeners are added to the document:
     - One for the 'keydown' event, which triggers `checkPressUp`.
     - One for the 'keyup' event, which triggers `resetPressUp`.

5. **Predicate Function `pressUp`:**
   - This function returns the current value of `upKeyPressed`, indicating whether the up arrow key is currently pressed (`true`) or not (`false`).

Through this implementation, the `pressUp` predicate dynamically updates and accurately reflects whether the up arrow key is pressed at any given moment.
