To implement the predicates as specified, we need to write JavaScript code that will interact with the cube's scale and listen for keyboard events to determine if the up arrow key is pressed. Below, I'll provide the TSL setup along with a JavaScript implementation for the predicate `pressUp(e)`.

### TSL Template Setup

First, let's outline the TSL structure:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Definition for the pressUp predicate in terms of keyboard events
  (pressUp(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Reactive behavior based on the predicate (Example: adjusting cube.scale.x when up is pressed)
}
```

### JavaScript Implementation

In the JavaScript implementation, we'll define the predicate `pressUp` by adding an event listener for the `keydown` and `keyup` events. This will help us track whether the up arrow key is currently pressed.

```javascript
// State variable to track if the up key is pressed
let upKeyPressed = false;

// Function to be triggered on keydown
function handleKeyDown(event) {
    if (event.key === "ArrowUp") {
        upKeyPressed = true;
    }
}

// Function to be triggered on keyup
function handleKeyUp(event) {
    if (event.key === "ArrowUp") {
        upKeyPressed = false;
    }
}

// Adding event listeners to the document
document.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
document.addEventListener('keyup', handleKeyUp);

// Predicate function for pressUp
function pressUp() {
    return upKeyPressed;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **State Variable**: `upKeyPressed` is used to track the state of the up arrow key. It is initially set to `false`.

2. **Event Handlers**: `handleKeyDown` and `handleKeyUp` functions update the `upKeyPressed` flag based on the key pressed. If the up arrow key (`ArrowUp`) is pressed or released, the state is updated accordingly.

3. **Event Listeners**: These listeners are added to the document to capture the `keydown` and `keyup` events that help in setting the `upKeyPressed` state.

4. **Predicate Function**: `pressUp` simply returns the current state of `upKeyPressed`, indicating whether the up arrow key is currently pressed or not.

This setup is suitable for integration with a TSL-based system, where the predicate `pressUp` can be used within the temporal logic specifications to define system behaviors based on the user's interaction with the keyboard, specifically the up arrow key. The example provided in the TSL template can be expanded to include specific actions or reactions within the `always guarantee` block, making use of the `pressUp` predicate to dynamically interact with the system environment (like modifying `cube.scale.x`) based on the state of `upKeyPressed`.
