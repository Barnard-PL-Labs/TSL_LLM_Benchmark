Here is how to translate the given natural language description into a TSL specification for the behavior of a cube's scale in reaction to user input:

```tsl
always assume {
  // The pressing and releasing of the up key are mutually exclusive, only one can be true at any time
  !(pressUp(e) && !pressUp(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // When the user presses the up button, increment the counter by 1 every frame
  pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

  // When the user is not pressing the up button, reset the counter to 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];

  // The scale value along the x-axis of the cube is updated with the value of the counter
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

Explanation:

- **Assumptions Block**: 
  - It assumes the mutual exclusivity of pressing and not pressing the up button. This condition ensures that at any time, only one of these can be true.

- **Guarantees Block**: 
  - The first guarantee specifies that when the up button is pressed (`pressUp(e)`), the counter `count` is incremented by 1 each frame. This creates a continuous increase in the counter value as long as the up button remains pressed.
  - The second guarantee handles the scenario when the up button is not being pressed (`!pressUp(e)`). In this case, it resets the counter `count` to 0.5.
  - The third guarantee links the cube's scale in the x-axis to the value of the counter `count`. This means that changes in the counter directly affect the cube's scale size along the x-axis, achieving the desired reactive scaling behavior based on user input.
