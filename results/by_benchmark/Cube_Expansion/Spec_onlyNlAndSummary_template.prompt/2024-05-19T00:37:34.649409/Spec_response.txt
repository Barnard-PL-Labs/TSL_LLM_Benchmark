Here's how the natural language description can be translated into a TSL specification:

```tsl
always assume {
  // assumption about key pressing
  // input to specify whether the up key is pressed or not
  (pressUp) ;
  (!pressUp) ;
}

always guarantee {
  // guarantee 1: When the user presses the up button, increment the counter (count) by 1 every frame
  pressUp -> [count <- count + 1];

  // guarantee 2: When the user is not pressing the up button, set the counter (count) to 0.5
  !pressUp -> [count <- 0.5];

  // guarantee 3: The scale value along the x-axis (cube.scale.x) is updated with the value of the counter (count)
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

Explanation:
- The `always assume` block specifies two assumptions about the state of the user pressing the up key: either it is being pressed (`pressUp`) or it is not being pressed (`!pressUp`).
- The `always guarantee` block contains three guarantees based on the input:
  - If `pressUp` is true, it increments a `count` variable by 1 every frame.
  - If `pressUp` is false, it resets the `count` to 0.5.
  - Regardless of the state of `pressUp`, it continually updates `cube.scale.x` to match the current value of `count`.
