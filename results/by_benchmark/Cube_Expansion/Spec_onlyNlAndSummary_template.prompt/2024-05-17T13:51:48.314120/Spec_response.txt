Here's the TSL specification for managing a cube's scale transformation based on user input described in the natural language specification:

```tsl
always assume {
  // No specific assumptions about the environment are stated, so this section can be left empty or focus on input constraints
}

always guarantee {
  // When the up button is not pressed, the counter remains at 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];

  // When the up button is pressed, increment the counter by 1 every frame
  pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

  // The cube's scale along the x-axis is updated with the value of the counter
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

This TSL setup addresses the requirements:
1. It maintains the counter at 0.5 when the up button is not pressed.
2. It increments the counter each frame while the up button is pressed.
3. It continuously updates the cube's scale on the x-axis with the current value of the counter.
