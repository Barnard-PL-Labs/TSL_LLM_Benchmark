To implement the predicate `pressUp(e)` in JavaScript, which checks if the user presses the up arrow key on their keyboard, follow the steps below. This predicate will be implemented to return a boolean value within a TSL (Temporal Stream Logic) environment. First, ensure that your TSL environment supports JavaScript-like syntax for event handling and predicates.

Let's set up the predicate within the TSL context:

### Step 1: Setup Event Listener
You need to add an event listener to the document that listens for the `keydown` event. When this event triggers, you'll check if the pressed key is the up arrow key. 

### Step 2: Define the Predicate
The predicate will check if the key pressed is the up arrow key, which corresponds to the key code `38`.

Here's how you might implement this within a typical JavaScript setup (outside of the TSL context, assuming there is similar support for event handling):

```javascript
let upKeyPressed = false;  // This variable holds the state of the up arrow key

// Add an event listener to the window to listen for keydown events
window.addEventListener('keydown', function(e) {
    if (e.keyCode === 38) {  // 38 is the key code for the up arrow key
        upKeyPressed = true;
    }
});

// Add an event listener to reset the state when the key is released
window.addEventListener('keyup', function(e) {
    if (e.keyCode === 38) {
        upKeyPressed = false;
    }
});

// Predicate function that checks the state of `upKeyPressed`
function pressUp() {
    return upKeyPressed;
}
```

### Incorporating into TSL
Within a TSL context and considering your requirement to not use and implement functions but predicates directly, we assume a similar setup where you can declare event listeners.

Hereâ€™s a speculative example of how it might look in a TSL file if TSL supports such event handling:

```plaintext
always assume {
  // Event listeners
  [keydown(e.keyCode) <- 38] -> X pressUp(e);  // Assuming TSL can process events and manage future states
  [keyup(e.keyCode) <- 38] -> X !pressUp(e);
}

always guarantee {
  // Use the predicate in guarantees as needed
}
```

This example assumes fictional capabilities of TSL to handle JavaScript-like event checking and state management. In practice, consult your specific TSL documentation to understand how to correctly integrate such interactive, event-driven logic.

If TSL does not support direct event handling:
- You may need to simulate the state within your environment or framework that bridges TSL with the actual system state. This bridge would manage the state (`upKeyPressed`) based on real-world events and pass this state to TSL predicates.
