Here is the TSL specification based on the given natural language description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure that pressing the up key and not pressing are mutually exclusive
  !(pressUp(e) && !pressUp(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // When the up key is pressed, increment the counter each frame
  pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

  // When the up key is not pressed, reset the counter to 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];

  // Update the cube's x-axis scale to match the counter value
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

This TSL code captures the behavior of a cube's scaling in response to user input from an up key, including how the scale and counter should behave when the key is pressed and when it is not.
