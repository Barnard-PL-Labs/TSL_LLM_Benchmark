Here is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Assume mutual exclusion of pressing and not pressing the up key
  !(pressUp(e) && !pressUp(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // When the up button is pressed, increment the counter by 1 each frame
  pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

  // When the up button is not pressed, set the counter to 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];

  // Update the cube's scale.x to match the current value of count
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

In this TSL specification:
- The assumption ensures that the `pressUp` event and its negation (`!pressUp`) are mutually exclusive, meaning they cannot happen at the same time.
- The guarantees handle the logic for incrementing the counter when the up key is pressed and resetting it to 0.5 when the up key is not pressed. The cube's x-axis scale is always set to the current value of `count`, thereby linking the visual scale of the cube directly to the user's interaction with the up key.
