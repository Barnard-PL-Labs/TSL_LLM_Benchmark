Here is the TSL specification based on the given natural language description:

```TSL
always assume {
   // Define that pressing the up button cannot be true and false at the same time
   !(pressUp(e) && !pressUp(e));
}

always guarantee {
   // When the user presses the up button, increment the counter each frame
   pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

   // When the user is not pressing the up button, reset the counter to 0.5
   !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];

   // The scale value along the x-axis is updated with the value of the counter
   [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions:** The assumption section clarifies that pressing the up key and not pressing it are mutually exclusive states. This is specified to ensure logical consistency in the simulation.

2. **Guarantees:**
   - When the "up" button is pressed (`pressUp(e)`), the counter `count` is incremented by 1 every frame, representing the continuous pressing and the resultant scaling operation.
   - When the "up" button is not being pressed (`!pressUp(e)`), the counter is reset to 0.5, returning the scale to its base state.
   - The cube's scale along the x-axis (`cube.scale.x`) is continuously updated to match the value of `count`, ensuring that the visual scale of the cube corresponds to the current counter value.
