To address the requirement of implementing the predicate `pressUp(e)` in JavaScript using the provided system environment, we will need to set up an event listener for the 'keydown' event on the document. This predicate will determine whether the up arrow key (which corresponds to the keycode `38`) is being pressed.

Here's a JavaScript implementation that suits the given problem description:

```javascript
// Assuming there's a global variable to track the state of the Up arrow key.
let isUpKeyPressed = false;

// Function to update the state based on keydown event
function updateKeyPressState(event) {
    // Check if the key pressed is the Up arrow key
    if (event.keyCode === 38) {
        isUpKeyPressed = true;
    }
}

// Function to reset the key state on keyup
function resetKeyPressState(event) {
    // Reset the state when the Up arrow key is released
    if (event.keyCode === 38) {
        isUpKeyPressed = false;
    }
}

// Adding event listeners to the document
document.addEventListener('keydown', updateKeyPressState);
document.addEventListener('keyup', resetKeyPressState);

// Predicate function to check if the Up key is pressed
function pressUp() {
    return isUpKeyPressed;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Global State Management**: `isUpKeyPressed` is a boolean variable that stores whether the up arrow key is currently being pressed.

2. **Event Handlers**:
   - `updateKeyPressState`: This function is triggered on the `keydown` event. It checks if the up arrow key (keycode 38) is the key being pressed. If so, it sets `isUpKeyPressed` to true.
   - `resetKeyPressState`: This function is triggered on the `keyup` event. It checks if the up arrow key is released and if so, sets `isUpKeyPressed` to false.

3. **Event Listeners**: Two listeners are added to the document:
   - One for `keydown` to invoke `updateKeyPressState`.
   - One for `keyup` to invoke `resetKeyPressState`.

4. **Predicate Function `pressUp`**: This function simply returns the current state of `isUpKeyPressed`, indicating whether the up arrow key is pressed.

This setup ensures that the state of the up arrow key is accurately tracked and can be queried at any time using the `pressUp()` function, which acts as a predicate in this context.
