Here's the TSL specification based on the natural language description provided:

```tsl
always assume {
  // User can push button1, button2, or button3, but not more than one at the same time
  !(button1 && button2) && !(button1 && button3) && !(button2 && button3);
}

always guarantee {
  // When button1 is pushed, write E4 to noteToPlay as the next action
  button1 -> X ([noteToPlay <- "E4"]);
  
  // When button2 is pushed, write G4 to noteToPlay as the next action
  button2 -> X ([noteToPlay <- "G4"]);
  
  // When button3 is pushed, write A4 to noteToPlay2, allowing it with other notes
  button3 -> X ([noteToPlay2 <- "A4"]);

  // Ensuring A4 on noteToPlay2 does not coincide with E4 on noteToPlay
  ([noteToPlay2 <- "A4"]) -> !(noteToPlay = "E4");

  // A4 cannot play on noteToPlay2 until E4 has stopped being played on noteToPlay
  ([noteToPlay <- "E4"]) -> F (!([noteToPlay <- "E4"]) && [noteToPlay2 <- "A4"]);

  // If E4 is played on noteToPlay, then A4 must eventually be played on noteToPlay2 and G4 on noteToPlay
  ([noteToPlay <- "E4"]) -> F ([noteToPlay2 <- "A4"] && [noteToPlay <- "G4"]);
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Assumptions**: 
   - Ensure that no two buttons can be pressed simultaneously, maintaining exclusive interaction.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - When each button is pressed, the respective sound note is assigned to the corresponding variable as the very next action (`X` operator ensures that the note assignment is the next step immediately following the button press).
   - Implement a condition where if A4 is played on `noteToPlay2`, then E4 must not be played on `noteToPlay` at the same time.
   - A4 can only be played after E4 has stopped playing, ensuring a sequence or delay in the notes being played.
   - There's a sequential requirement for playing E4 followed by A4 on `noteToPlay2` and G4 on `noteToPlay`, creating a musical sequence or chord sequence based on user interaction.
