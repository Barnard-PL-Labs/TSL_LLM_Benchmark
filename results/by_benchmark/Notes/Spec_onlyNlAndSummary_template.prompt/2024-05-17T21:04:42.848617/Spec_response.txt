Here is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description:

```
always assume {
  // Assume the exclusive usage of buttons
  !(button1 && button2);
  !(button1 && button3);
  !(button2 && button3);
}

always guarantee {
  // Guarantee that pressing button1 results in playing the note E4 in the next action
  button1 -> X ([noteToPlay <- "E4"]);
  
  // Guarantee that pressing button2 results in playing the note G4 in the next action
  button2 -> X ([noteToPlay <- "G4"]);
  
  // Guarantee that pressing button3 results in playing the note A4, but on a different variable, and allowing concurrency
  button3 -> X ([noteToPlay2 <- "A4"]);

  // Maintain mutual exclusivity for playing E4 and A4 at the same time
  ([noteToPlay2 <- "A4"]) -> !(X ([noteToPlay <- "E4"]));
  
  // A4 cannot be played on noteToPlay2 until E4 has stopped being played on noteToPlay
  ([noteToPlay <- "E4"]) -> !F([noteToPlay2 <- "A4"]) W !([noteToPlay <- "E4"]);

  // If E4 is played on noteToPlay, then A4 must eventually be played on noteToPlay2, and G4 on noteToPlay
  ([noteToPlay <- "E4"]) -> F([noteToPlay2 <- "A4"] && [noteToPlay <- "G4"]);
}
```

This specification models the behavior of a musical interface where button pushes result in corresponding notes being played. It includes assumptions for exclusive button usage and guarantees for the immediate and future behavior of note playing, ensuring specific interactions between the notes, particularly around the exclusivity and sequencing of playing E4 and A4.
