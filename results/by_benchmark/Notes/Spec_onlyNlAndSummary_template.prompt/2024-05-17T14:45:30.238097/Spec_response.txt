Here's the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Assumption that only one button can be pushed at a time
  !(button1 && button2) && !(button1 && button3) && !(button2 && button3);
}

always guarantee {
  // Guarantee that pressing button1 leads to playing E4 as the next sound on noteToPlay
  button1 -> X ([noteToPlay <- "E4"]);

  // Guarantee that pressing button2 leads to playing G4 as the next sound on noteToPlay
  button2 -> X ([noteToPlay <- "G4"]);

  // Guarantee that pressing button3 leads to playing A4 on noteToPlay2, allowing simultaneous playing with noteToPlay
  button3 -> X ([noteToPlay2 <- "A4"]);

  // E4 on noteToPlay and A4 on noteToPlay2 cannot be played simultaneously
  (X ([noteToPlay <- "E4"]) && X ([noteToPlay2 <- "A4"])) -> false;

  // A4 can not be played on noteToPlay2 until E4 has stopped being played on noteToPlay
  ([noteToPlay2 <- "A4"]) -> !(noteToPlay = "E4");

  // If E4 is played on noteToPlay, then A4 must eventually be played on noteToPlay2 and G4 on noteToPlay
  ([noteToPlay <- "E4"]) -> F ([noteToPlay2 <- "A4"] && [noteToPlay <- "G4"]);
}
```

This TSL code captures the behavior of the buttons and their associated musical notes as described. It ensures that specific actions (like playing a musical note) follow the pressing of each button and manages the conditions under which different notes can be played concurrently or in sequence.
