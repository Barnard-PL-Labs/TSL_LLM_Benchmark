Here's how you can convert the provided natural language description into a TSL (Temporal Stream Logic) specification:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Button presses are exclusive events
  !(button1 && button2);
  !(button1 && button3);
  !(button2 && button3);
}

always guarantee {
  // Guarantee 1: When button1 is pressed, E4 is the next note to be played on noteToPlay
  button1 -> X ([noteToPlay <- "E4"]);

  // Guarantee 2: When button2 is pressed, G4 is the next note to be played on noteToPlay
  button2 -> X ([noteToPlay <- "G4"]);

  // Guarantee 3: When button3 is pressed, A4 is the next note to be played on noteToPlay2
  button3 -> X ([noteToPlay2 <- "A4"]);

  // Guarantee 5: If A4 is playing on noteToPlay2, E4 cannot play on noteToPlay at the same time
  [noteToPlay2 <- "A4"] -> ![noteToPlay <- "E4"];

  // Guarantee 6: A4 on noteToPlay2 cannot be played until E4 has stopped on noteToPlay
  ([noteToPlay <- "E4"]) -> !F([noteToPlay2 <- "A4"]);

  // Guarantee 7: If E4 is played on noteToPlay, then A4 must eventually be played on noteToPlay2, and G4 on noteToPlay
  [noteToPlay <- "E4"] -> F([noteToPlay2 <- "A4"] && F([noteToPlay <- "G4"]));
}
```

### Explanation
- **Assumptions:** We start by ensuring that the button presses are mutually exclusive using negations. This means you can't press two buttons at the same time.
  
- **Guarantees:**
  - **Guarantee 1-3:** These directly translate the button presses into actions that write specific musical notes to their respective variables, and they ensure these are the next actions to occur.
  - **Guarantee 5:** Implements the condition where two specific notes can't be played at the same time by negating the simultaneous output.
  - **Guarantee 6:** Ensures that A4 on `noteToPlay2` does not play if E4 is currently playing on `noteToPlay`.
  - **Guarantee 7:** Sets a sequential guarantee where if E4 is played, then A4 and G4 must follow in the order specified on the respective outputs.

This TSL specification captures all the conditions and relationships expressed in the natural language requirements for managing the relationships between button presses and musical notes outputs, respecting temporal constraints.
