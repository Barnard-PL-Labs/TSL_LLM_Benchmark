This TSL specification captures the assumptions about button inputs and ensures that specific musical notes are played according to the button pressed, with the required relationships and sequences between playing on `noteToPlay` and `noteToPlay2`. The `F` operator ensures eventual actions, while `X` specifies the immediate next state. The mutual exclusion conditions prevent specific notes from being played simultaneously on different variables, maintaining the integrity of the musical output as per the guarantees.
