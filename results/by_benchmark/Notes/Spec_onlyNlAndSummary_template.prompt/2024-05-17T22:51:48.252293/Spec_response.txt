Here is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Define the input states for button presses
  button1 || button2 || button3;
}

always guarantee {
  // Guarantee that pressing button1 will play E4 as the next note on "noteToPlay"
  button1 -> X ([noteToPlay <- E4]);

  // Guarantee that pressing button2 will play G4 as the next note on "noteToPlay"
  button2 -> X ([noteToPlay <- G4]);

  // Guarantee that pressing button3 will play A4 as the next note on "noteToPlay2"
  button3 -> X ([noteToPlay2 <- A4]);

  // Ensure that E4 and A4 cannot be played at the same time on "noteToPlay" and "noteToPlay2" respectively
  ([noteToPlay <- E4] && X [noteToPlay2 <- A4]) -> false;
  ([noteToPlay2 <- A4] && X [noteToPlay <- E4]) -> false;

  // A4 cannot be played on "noteToPlay2" until E4 has stopped being played on "noteToPlay"
  (X [noteToPlay <- E4]) -> !F([noteToPlay2 <- A4]);

  // If E4 is played on "noteToPlay", then A4 must eventually be played on "noteToPlay2" and G4 on "noteToPlay"
  [noteToPlay <- E4] -> F([noteToPlay2 <- A4] && [noteToPlay <- G4]);
}
```

This TSL specification includes:
- Assumptions about button presses as inputs.
- Guarantees that determine the behavior of note playing in response to these button presses.
- Specific conditions around the simultaneous and sequential playing of notes based on button presses and note variable assignments.
