  button2 -> F ([noteToPlay <- "G4"]);

  button3 -> F ([noteToPlay2 <- "A4"]);

  button1 -> X ([noteToPlay <- "E4"]);

  // If A4 is played on "noteToPlay2", then E4 cannot be played on "noteToPlay" at the same time

  // A4 cannot be played on "noteToPlay2" until E4 has stopped being played on "noteToPlay"
  ([noteToPlay <- "E4"]) -> F (!([noteToPlay <- "E4"]) U ([noteToPlay2 <- "A4"]));

  // If E4 is played on "noteToPlay", then A4 must eventually be played on "noteToPlay2" and G4 on "noteToPlay"

```

This TSL specification encapsulates the behaviors described in your natural language description by defining assumptions about the buttons available and guarantees that dictate how the musical notes should be managed and triggered based on user interactions. These rules ensure that the system responds appropriately to button presses, managing simultaneous and sequential note plays as specified.
