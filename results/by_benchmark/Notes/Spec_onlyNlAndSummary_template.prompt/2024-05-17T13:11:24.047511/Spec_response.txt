Here is the TSL specification based on the given description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Define that each button can be pressed independently
  !(button1 && button2);
  !(button1 && button3);
  !(button2 && button3);
}

always guarantee {
  // When button1 is pressed, E4 should be played next on noteToPlay
  button1 -> X ([noteToPlay <- E4]);

  // When button2 is pressed, G4 should be played next on noteToPlay
  button2 -> X ([noteToPlay <- G4]);

  // When button3 is pressed, A4 should be played on noteToPlay2
  button3 -> X ([noteToPlay2 <- A4]);

  // E4 on noteToPlay and A4 on noteToPlay2 cannot be played at the same time
  ([noteToPlay <- E4] && [noteToPlay2 <- A4]) -> false;

  // A4 cannot be played on noteToPlay2 until E4 has stopped being played on noteToPlay
  [noteToPlay <- E4] -> (! [noteToPlay2 <- A4] W [noteToPlay <- null]);

  // If E4 is played on noteToPlay, then A4 must eventually be played on noteToPlay2 and G4 on noteToPlay
  [noteToPlay <- E4] -> F ([noteToPlay2 <- A4] && [noteToPlay <- G4]);
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions** ensure that the buttons are mutually exclusive in their activation, meaning no two buttons can be pressed at the same time.
2. **Guarantees** detail the actions that should occur when each button is pressed:
   - Immediate action (`X`) is used to specify that the notes E4 or G4 should be the next action to occur when button1 or button2 is pressed, respectively.
   - Exclusive play of E4 and A4 to avoid simultaneous play on both `noteToPlay` and `noteToPlay2`.
   - Enforced delay for playing A4 on `noteToPlay2` until after E4 has stopped playing on `noteToPlay`.
   - Sequential or chord play is set up by the eventual (`F`) playing of A4 on `noteToPlay2` and G4 on `noteToPlay` if E4 is initially played on `noteToPlay`.
