Here's the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Assume only one button can be pressed at a time to simplify the logic (mutual exclusion)
  !(button1 && button2) && !(button1 && button3) && !(button2 && button3);
}

always guarantee {
  // Guarantee 1
  button1 -> X ([noteToPlay <- "E4"]);
  
  // Guarantee 2
  button2 -> X ([noteToPlay <- "G4"]);
  
  // Guarantee 3
  button3 -> X ([noteToPlay2 <- "A4"]);
  
  // Guarantee 4: Directly after pressing button1 or button2, the specified note should be written to noteToPlay
  // This is already covered implicitly by the use of "X" in Guarantees 1 and 2

  // Guarantee 5: Mutual exclusion between E4 on noteToPlay and A4 on noteToPlay2
  ([noteToPlay <- "E4"] && [noteToPlay2 <- "A4"]) -> false;
  
  // Guarantee 6: A4 on noteToPlay2 must wait until E4 has stopped being played on noteToPlay
  ([noteToPlay <- "E4"]) -> (! ([noteToPlay2 <- "A4"]) W !(button1));
  
  // Guarantee 7: If E4 is played on noteToPlay, then ensure A4 and G4 follow respectively
  ([noteToPlay <- "E4"]) -> F ([noteToPlay2 <- "A4"] && later X ([noteToPlay <- "G4"]));
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Assumptions** ensure that only one button can be activated at a time, preventing overlapping inputs that could complicate the logic.
- **Guarantee 1-3** establish that pressing a specific button will cause a specific note to be set up for playing in the next system state on the respective variable (`noteToPlay` or `noteToPlay2`).
- An explicit guarantee about mutual exclusivity when both notes "E4" and "A4" are to be played at the same time is encoded in **Guarantee 5** to prevent them from being played simultaneously if set in different variables.
- **Guarantee 6** ensures that A4 is not played on `noteToPlay2` until E4 has ceased, providing control over the sequence of play.
- **Guarantee 7** links the play of E4 to ensure a subsequent sequence where A4 and then G4 is played, demonstrating a controlled sequence or chord progression.

This setup provides a robust specification for managing the musical notes as per the described system's behavior and constraints.
