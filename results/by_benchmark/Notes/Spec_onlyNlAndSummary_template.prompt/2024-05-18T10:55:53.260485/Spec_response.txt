This TSL specification considers all given requirements and relationships between the actions (button presses) and their effects (note playing). It ensures that the correct musical notes are played according to which button is pressed, that notes are not played simultaneously if not allowed, and that certain sequences or chords are programmatically mandated to follow one another.
