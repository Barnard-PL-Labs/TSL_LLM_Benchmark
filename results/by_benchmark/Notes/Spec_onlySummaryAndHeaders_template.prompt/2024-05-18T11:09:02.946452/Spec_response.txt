Here is a TSL specification based on your description of a system where musical notes (E4, G4, A4) are played in response to user button presses, with two notes possibly being played simultaneously:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Define the exclusive relationship between pressing the buttons for E4, G4, and A4
  !(pressE4(e) && pressG4(e)) ;
  !(pressE4(e) && pressA4(e)) ;
  !(pressG4(e) && pressA4(e)) ;
}

always guarantee {
  // Play E4 when its corresponding button is pressed
  pressE4(e) -> [noteToPlay <- "E4"] ;

  // Play G4 when its corresponding button is pressed
  pressG4(e) -> [noteToPlay <- "G4"] ;

  // Play A4 when its corresponding button is pressed
  pressA4(e) -> [noteToPlay <- "A4"] ;

  // Allow for simultaneous playing of two notes, ensuring no overlap in noteToPlay and noteToPlay2
  (pressE4(e) && pressG4(e)) -> ([noteToPlay <- "E4"] && [noteToPlay2 <- "G4"]) ;
  (pressE4(e) && pressA4(e)) -> ([noteToPlay <- "E4"] && [noteToPlay2 <- "A4"]) ;
  (pressG4(e) && pressA4(e)) -> ([noteToPlay <- "G4"] && [noteToPlay2 <- "A4"]) ;
}
```

This TSL specification assumes:
1. Mutual exclusivity in pressing buttons for different notes within the same category (e.g., cannot press E4 and G4 at the same time).
2. Ensures that the note corresponding to the button pressed is played by updating the "noteToPlay" variable.
3. Manages the possibility of playing two notes simultaneously by using two variables ("noteToPlay" and "noteToPlay2") to handle cases where two buttons are pressed.
