```tsl
always assume {
  // There are no specific environment assumptions provided
}

always guarantee {
  // When the button for E4 is pressed, set noteToPlay to 'E4'
  pressButtonE4 -> [noteToPlay <- 'E4'];

  // When the button for G4 is pressed, set noteToPlay to 'G4'
  pressButtonG4 -> [noteToPlay <- 'G4'];

  // When the button for A4 is pressed, set noteToPlay to 'A4'
  pressButtonA4 -> [noteToPlay <- 'A4'];

  // Assuming another set of buttons can also trigger sounds simultaneously on noteToPlay2
  pressButtonE4_2 -> [noteToPlay2 <- 'E4'];
  pressButtonG4_2 -> [noteToPlay2 <- 'G4'];
  pressButtonA4_2 -> [noteToPlay2 <- 'A4'];
}
```
This TSL code assumes there are separate buttons for triggering each of the musical notes on two different variables `noteToPlay` and `noteToPlay2`. Each press of a button results in the corresponding note being set on the respective variable.
