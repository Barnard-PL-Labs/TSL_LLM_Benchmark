  // When the user pushes button2, play the note G4 on noteToPlay
  pressButton2 -> [noteToPlay <- "G4"];

  // When the user pushes button3, play the note A4 on noteToPlay
  pressButton3 -> [noteToPlay <- "A4"];

  // When the user pushes button4, play the note E4 on noteToPlay2
  pressButton4 -> [noteToPlay2 <- "E4"];

  // When the user pushes button5, play the note G4 on noteToPlay2
  pressButton5 -> [noteToPlay2 <- "G4"];

  // When the user pushes button6, play the note A4 on noteToPlay2
  pressButton6 -> [noteToPlay2 <- "A4"];
}
```

This TSL code reflects a simple interaction where pressing different buttons triggers different musical notes to be played on two possible channels (`noteToPlay` and `noteToPlay2`). Each button is associated with a unique musical note, allowing for simultaneous notes if different buttons control different variables.
