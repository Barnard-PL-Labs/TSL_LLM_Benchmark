Here is the TSL specification based on the description provided:

```tsl
always assume {
  // No specific assumptions about the environment are given
}

always guarantee {
  // Define the behavior when buttons corresponding to musical notes are pressed
  pressE4 -> [noteToPlay <- "E4"];
  pressG4 -> [noteToPlay <- "G4"];
  pressA4 -> [noteToPlay <- "A4"];

  // If two buttons are pressed simultaneously, assign values to both variables
  (pressE4 && pressG4) -> ([noteToPlay <- "E4"] && [noteToPlay2 <- "G4"]);
  (pressE4 && pressA4) -> ([noteToPlay <- "E4"] && [noteToPlay2 <- "A4"]);
  (pressG4 && pressA4) -> ([noteToPlay <- "G4"] && [noteToPlay2 <- "A4"]);
}
```

This TSL code sets up the behavior for single and simultaneous button presses that result in musical notes being played. Each press corresponds to setting a musical note in the designated variable to control sound output.
