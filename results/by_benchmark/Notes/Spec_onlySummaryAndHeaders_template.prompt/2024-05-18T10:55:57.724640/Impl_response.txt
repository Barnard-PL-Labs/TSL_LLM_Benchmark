Since there are no functions or predicates to implement and there is no provided API, the corresponding JavaScript code block will be empty. Below is the representation of an empty JavaScript code block with a simple comment to clarify its purpose:

```javascript
// This is an empty code block as there are no functions or predicates to implement and no API provided.
```

This block does nothing and is provided to fulfill the requirement of providing a JavaScript implementation based on the given instructions.
