Given that there are no functions or predicates to implement and no System API provided, you would simply have an empty JavaScript code block. Here is how it would look:

```javascript
// Empty code block as there are no functions or predicates to implement.
```

This block contains no operations, functions, or API interactions, aligning with the instructions provided.
