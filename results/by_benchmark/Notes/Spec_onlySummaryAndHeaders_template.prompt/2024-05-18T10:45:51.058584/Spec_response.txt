Here is the TSL specification based on your description:

```
always assume {
  // Define the exclusive relationship between the notes being played simultaneously
  !(noteToPlay = 'E4' && noteToPlay2 = 'E4');
  !(noteToPlay = 'G4' && noteToPlay2 = 'G4');
  !(noteToPlay = 'A4' && noteToPlay2 = 'A4');
}

always guarantee {
  // Define the behavior of writing the note values to variables when specific buttons are pressed
  pressButtonE4 -> [noteToPlay <- 'E4'];
  pressButtonG4 -> [noteToPlay <- 'G4'];
  pressButtonA4 -> [noteToPlay <- 'A4'];

  pressButtonE4AndG4 -> ([noteToPlay <- 'E4'] && [noteToPlay2 <- 'G4']);
  pressButtonE4AndA4 -> ([noteToPlay <- 'E4'] && [noteToPlay2 <- 'A4']);
  pressButtonG4AndA4 -> ([noteToPlay <- 'G4'] && [noteToPlay2 <- 'A4']);
}
```
