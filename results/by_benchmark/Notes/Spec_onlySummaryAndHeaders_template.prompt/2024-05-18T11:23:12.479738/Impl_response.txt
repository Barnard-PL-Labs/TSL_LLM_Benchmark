Given that there are no functions or predicates to implement and there is no system API provided, the resulting JavaScript code block will be empty. Here is how you can represent this:

```javascript
// No functions or predicates to implement based on the provided details.
```

This empty code block represents the completion of the task as described without any further implementation required. If there are any changes or additions to the task requirements, those can be implemented accordingly.
