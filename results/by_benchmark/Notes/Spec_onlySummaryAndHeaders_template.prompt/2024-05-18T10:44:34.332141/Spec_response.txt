Here is the TSL specification based on your description:

```TSL
always assume {
  // No special assumptions about the environment
}

always guarantee {
  // Define actions to play notes based on button presses
  pressButtonE -> [noteToPlay <- "E4"];
  pressButtonG -> [noteToPlay <- "G4"];
  pressButtonA -> [noteToPlay <- "A4"];
  
  // Conditions to potentially play two notes simultaneously
  (pressButtonE && pressButtonG) -> ([noteToPlay <- "E4"] && [noteToPlay2 <- "G4"]);
  (pressButtonE && pressButtonA) -> ([noteToPlay <- "E4"] && [noteToPlay2 <- "A4"]);
  (pressButtonG && pressButtonA) -> ([noteToPlay <- "G4"] && [noteToPlay2 <- "A4"]);
}
```

This specification assumes there are buttons corresponding to the musical notes E4, G4, and A4, and the variables `noteToPlay` and `noteToPlay2` are available to hold the values of the notes to be played. The `pressButtonX` predicates are triggers for pressing the respective note buttons.
