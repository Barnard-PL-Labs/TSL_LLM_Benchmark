Here is a TSL specification based on the provided description:

```TSL
always assume {
  // Assuming there are no specific assumptions required for this scenario
}

always guarantee {
  // When buttonE is pressed, E4 note should be played
  pressButtonE -> [noteToPlay <- "E4"];

  // When buttonG is pressed, G4 note should be played
  pressButtonG -> [noteToPlay <- "G4"];

  // When buttonA is pressed, A4 note should be played
  pressButtonA -> [noteToPlay <- "A4"];

  // Allowing simultaneous notes to be played on a second channel
  pressButtonE -> [noteToPlay2 <- "E4"];
  pressButtonG -> [noteToPlay2 <- "G4"];
  pressButtonA -> [noteToPlay2 <- "A4"];
}
``` 

This TSL code snippet assumes the presence of button press events (`pressButtonE`, `pressButtonG`, `pressButtonA`) and uses these events to conditionally control the assignment of musical note values to `noteToPlay` and `noteToPlay2`, allowing for the possibility of two notes being played simultaneously. Note that the specifics of handling simultaneous notes might need additional logic depending on the exact requirements and system capabilities.
