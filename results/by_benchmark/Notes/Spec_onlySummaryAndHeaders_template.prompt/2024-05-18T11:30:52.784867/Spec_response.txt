```tsl
always assume {
  // Define the mutual exclusion for playing notes E4, G4, and A4
  !([noteToPlay <- "E4"] && [noteToPlay <- "G4"]) ;
  !([noteToPlay <- "E4"] && [noteToPlay <- "A4"]) ;
  !([noteToPlay <- "G4"] && [noteToPlay <- "A4"]) ;
  !([noteToPlay2 <- "E4"] && [noteToPlay2 <- "G4"]) ;
  !([noteToPlay2 <- "E4"] && [noteToPlay2 <- "A4"]) ;
  !([noteToPlay2 <- "G4"] && [noteToPlay2 <- "A4"]) ;
}

always guarantee {
  // Define the behavior of playing notes
  [buttonPress1] -> ([noteToPlay <- "E4"] || [noteToPlay2 <- "E4"]) ;
  [buttonPress2] -> ([noteToPlay <- "G4"] || [noteToPlay2 <- "G4"]) ;
  [buttonPress3] -> ([noteToPlay <- "A4"] || [noteToPlay2 <- "A4"]) ;
}
```

This TSL specification captures the mutual exclusivity of playing each note individually but allows for two notes to be played simultaneously if they are assigned to different variables (`noteToPlay` and `noteToPlay2`). The `buttonPress1`, `buttonPress2`, and `buttonPress3` events trigger the respective musical notes.
