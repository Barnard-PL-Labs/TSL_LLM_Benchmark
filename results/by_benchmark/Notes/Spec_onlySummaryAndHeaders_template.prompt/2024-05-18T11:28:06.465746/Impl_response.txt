Since there are no functions or predicates to implement and there is no specific API provided, we can safely write an empty JavaScript code block:

```javascript
// Empty code block
```

This block meets the requirements as specified in the description. If additional functionality or specific implementations are needed in the future, this code block can be expanded accordingly.
