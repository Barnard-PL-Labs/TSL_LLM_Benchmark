Here is a TSL specification based on your description of a user pushing buttons to produce musical notes, where the sounds E4, G4, and A4 can be played through `noteToPlay` or `noteToPlay2`:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Define the mutually exclusive relationship between buttons for E4, G4, and A4
  !(buttonE4 && buttonG4);
  !(buttonE4 && buttonA4);
  !(buttonG4 && buttonA4);
}

always guarantee {
  // When button for E4 is pressed, set noteToPlay or noteToPlay2 to "E4"
  buttonE4 -> ([noteToPlay <- "E4"] || [noteToPlay2 <- "E4"]);

  // When button for G4 is pressed, set noteToPlay or noteToPlay2 to "G4"
  buttonG4 -> ([noteToPlay <- "G4"] || [noteToPlay2 <- "G4"]);

  // When button for A4 is pressed, set noteToPlay or noteToPlay2 to "A4"
  buttonA4 -> ([noteToPlay <- "A4"] || [noteToPlay2 <- "A4"]);
}
```

This specification ensures that when respective buttons for the musical notes E4, G4, and A4 are pressed, the corresponding note is written to either `noteToPlay` or `noteToPlay2`. The mutual exclusion part ensures that no two buttons can be pressed simultaneously, avoiding potential conflicts in output.
