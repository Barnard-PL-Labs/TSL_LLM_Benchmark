}
```
This TSL specification sets up a system where pressing different buttons results in different musical notes being played. "noteToPlay" and "noteToPlay2" are used for outputting the musical notes, allowing two notes to be played simultaneously if two buttons are pressed. The mutual exclusivity ensures that only the combinations mentioned explicitly will trigger dual notes.
