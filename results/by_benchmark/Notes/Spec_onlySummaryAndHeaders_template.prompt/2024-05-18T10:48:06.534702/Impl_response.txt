Since there are no functions or predicates to implement and no System API specified, the JavaScript implementation would simply be an empty code block. Here is how that would be represented:

```javascript
// Empty code block as per the specifications
```

The code contains no operations, fulfilling the requirement of both not implementing any functions or predicates and having no interaction with a non-existent API.
