  // A4 on noteToPlay2 cannot be played until E4 has stopped being played on noteToPlay
  ([noteToPlay <- "E4"]) -> (!([noteToPlay2 <- "A4"]) W ([noteToPlay <- !"E4"]));

  // If E4 is played on noteToPlay, then A4 must eventually be played on noteToPlay2 and G4 on noteToPlay

This TSL specification reflects the described behaviors and constraints regarding the interaction of button presses and musical note outputs.
