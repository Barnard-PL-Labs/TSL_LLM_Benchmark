  // Ensure the next action after button press is to play the respective note

  // Relationship between notes played by noteToPlay and noteToPlay2
  ([ noteToPlay2 <- "A4" ] -> !([ noteToPlay <- "E4" ]));

This TSL specification represents the logical requirements based on the natural language description of the behavior of a system reacting to button presses and producing musical notes. It includes conditions for button presses leading to musical notes, ensures immediacy in note playing after a button press, and manages the exclusivity and sequence of notes between two variables.
