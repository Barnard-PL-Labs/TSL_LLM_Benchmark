  // A4 cannot be played on noteToPlay2 until E4 has stopped being played on noteToPlay
  (noteToPlay = "E4") -> (G !(noteToPlay = "E4") -> F ([noteToPlay2 <- "A4"]));

  // If E4 is played on noteToPlay, then A4 must eventually be played on noteToPlay2 and G4 on noteToPlay

}
```
This TSL specification captures the provided requirements by assuming three buttons that can be pushed and guarantees that specific notes will play based on button interactions. Additional logical constraints manage the conditions and sequencing related to playing notes simultaneously or consecutively.
