### Explanation
1. **Variable Initialization**: Output variables `outputNoteToPlay` and `outputNoteToPlay2` are initialized to the current state's `noteToPlay` and `noteToPlay2` variables to ensure continuity unless changes are needed.

2. **Button Checks**: 
   - **Button1**: When pressed, it sets `noteToPlay` to "E4". If "E4" is currently playing, it schedules "A4" to be played on `noteToPlay2` assuming it's not simultaneously playing "E4".
   - **Button2**: When pressed, it sets `noteToPlay` to "G4".
   - **Button3**: If pressed and "E4" is not playing on `noteToPlay`, it sets `noteToPlay2` to "A4".

3. **Conflict Resolution**: If "E4" is set to play on `noteToPlay` and "A4" on `noteToPlay2` simultaneously, it clears `noteToPlay2` to prevent simultaneous play, meeting the requirements stated.

4. **Return Statement**: Outputs the current state along with the potentially updated `noteToPlay` and `noteToPlay2`, encapsulated in an object.
