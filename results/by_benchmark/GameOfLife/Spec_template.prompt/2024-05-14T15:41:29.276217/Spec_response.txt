Here is the TSL specification that reflects the behavior of a single cell in the Game of Life based on the given rules and functions:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure that comeAlive and comeDead cannot both be true at the same time
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If comeAlive is true, then the cell uses changeState() to become alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [changeState()];

  // If comeDead is true, then the cell uses changeState() to die
  comeDead(index) -> [changeState()];
}
```

In this specification:
- The `assume` block ensures that the predicates `comeAlive` and `comeDead` for a given cell cannot both be true at the same time, reflecting the mutual exclusivity of these conditions.
- The `guarantee` block specifies the actions to be taken when either `comeAlive` or `comeDead` predicates are true, in both cases using the `changeState()` function to toggle the state of the cell. The use of `comeAlive` and `comeDead` directly triggers the state change, adhering to the rules of the Game of Life.
