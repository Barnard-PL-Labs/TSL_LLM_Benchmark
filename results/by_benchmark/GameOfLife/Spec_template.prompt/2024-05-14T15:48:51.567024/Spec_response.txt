Here is the TSL specification for a state machine that simulates a single cell in the Game of Life based on the provided functions and predicates:

```plaintext
always assume {
  // comeAlive and comeDead cannot both be true at the same time
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If comeAlive is true, the cell uses changeState() to come alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [changeState()];

  // If comeDead is true, the cell uses changeState() to die
  comeDead(index) -> [changeState()];
}
```

In this TSL specification:
- The `always assume` block ensures that the conditions `comeAlive` and `comeDead` cannot both hold true for the same cell at the same time, reflecting the mutually exclusive nature of these conditions.
- The `always guarantee` block specifies that if `comeAlive` is true for a cell, then the cell's state is changed to alive using the `changeState()` function. Similarly, if `comeDead` is true, the cell's state is changed to dead using the same `changeState()` function.
