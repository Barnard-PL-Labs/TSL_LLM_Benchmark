Here is the TSL specification for the single cell simulation in the game of life based on the provided functions and predicates:

```
always assume {
  // comeAlive and comeDead are mutually exclusive
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If comeAlive is true, the cell changes state to come alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [changeState()];

  // If comeDead is true, the cell changes state to die
  comeDead(index) -> [changeState()];
}
```
