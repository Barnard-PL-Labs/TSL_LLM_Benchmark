Here is the TSL specification based on the provided information and the requirements of the game of life for a single cell:

```tsl
always assume {
  // comeAlive and comeDead cannot both be true at the same time
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If comeAlive is true the cell uses changeState() to come alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [changeState()];

  // If comeDead is true the cell uses changeState() to die
  comeDead(index) -> [changeState()];
}
```

This TSL code captures the behavior of a cell in Conway's Game of Life, where the cell changes state based on the number of live neighbors it has, and ensures that the functions determining whether the cell comes alive or dies are mutually exclusive. The guarantees ensure that the cell's state is changed appropriately based on the conditions evaluated by `comeAlive` and `comeDead`.
