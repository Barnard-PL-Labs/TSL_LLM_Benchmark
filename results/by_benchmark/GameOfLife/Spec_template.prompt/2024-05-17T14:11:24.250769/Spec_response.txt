Here is the TSL specification for the given scenario, which is a simple model of a cell's behavior in the game of life according to the rules provided:

```tsl
always assume {
  // comeAlive and comeDead cannot both be true at the same time
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If comeAlive is true, the cell uses changeState() to come alive
  comeAlive(index) -> ([changeState()] && [alive <- true]);

  // If comeDead is true, the cell uses changeState() to die
  comeDead(index) -> ([changeState()] && [alive <- false]);
}
```

This TSL specification captures the basic logic of a cell's behavior in Conway's Game of Life based on the two predicates `comeAlive` and `comeDead`. It ensures that the cell changes its state according to the rules defined by these predicates, using the `changeState()` function to either come alive or die.
