Here's the TSL specification for the single cell in the game of Life based on the provided description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // comeAlive and comeDead cannot both be true at the same time
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If comeAlive is true, the cell uses changeState() to come alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [alive <- true];

  // If comeDead is true, the cell uses changeState() to die
  comeDead(index) -> [alive <- false];
}
```
