Here's a TSL specification based on the provided natural language description, translating the rules of Conway's Game of Life for a single cell:

```tsl
always assume {
  // comeAlive and comeDead are mutually exclusive
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If comeAlive(index) is true, then the cell state changes to alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [changeState()];

  // If comeDead(index) is true, then the cell state changes to dead
  comeDead(index) -> [changeState()];
}
```

This TSL specification ensures that the cell will change its state accurately depending on whether it should come alive or die, according to the rules evaluated by the `comeAlive` and `comeDead` functions for a specific cell index.
