To create the TSL specification for a single cell in the game of life based on the provided functions and predicates, you would need to define the assumptions and guarantees that govern the behavior of the cell in response to its neighbors. Here is how you can translate the given natural language description into a TSL spec:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Assumption that comeAlive and comeDead cannot both be true at the same time
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // Guarantee that if comeAlive is true, the cell uses changeState() to become alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [alive <- true];

  // Guarantee that if comeDead is true, the cell uses changeState() to die
  comeDead(index) -> [alive <- false];
}
```

Here's a breakdown of the TSL code:

### Assumptions:
- The assumption `!(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index))` ensures that the predicates `comeAlive` and `comeDead` for a given cell cannot both be true simultaneously. This prevents contradictory states where a cell would be commanded to both live and die at the same time.

### Guarantees:
- The guarantee `comeAlive(index) -> [alive <- true]` states that if the predicate `comeAlive(index)` evaluates to true (i.e., the conditions for the cell to become alive are met), then the cell's state (`alive`) is set to true, indicating the cell is now alive.
- The guarantee `comeDead(index) -> [alive <- false]` establishes that if the predicate `comeDead(index)` is true (i.e., the conditions for the cell to die are satisfied), then the state of the cell (`alive`) is set to false, signifying that the cell is now dead.

This TSL specification aligns with the rules of Conway's Game of Life and ensures that each cell's state transitions are governed strictly by its neighboring cells' states as evaluated by the `comeAlive` and `comeDead` functions.
