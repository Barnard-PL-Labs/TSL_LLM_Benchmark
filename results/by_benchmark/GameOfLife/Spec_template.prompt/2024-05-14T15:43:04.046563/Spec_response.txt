Here is the TSL specification based on the natural language description provided for simulating a single cell in Conway's Game of Life:

```tsl
always assume {
  // comAlive and comeDead cannot both be true at the same time
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If comeAlive is true the cell uses changeState() to come alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [alive <- changeState()];

  // If comeDead is true the cell uses changeState() to die
  comeDead(index) -> [alive <- changeState()];
}
```

This TSL specification captures the behavior of a single cell based on the `comeAlive` and `comeDead` predicates which determine whether the cell should become alive or die, respectively. The `changeState()` function is called to update the `alive` state of the cell accordingly.
