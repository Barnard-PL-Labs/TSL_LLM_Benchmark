In TSL (Temporal Stream Logic), your specification needs to clearly define the assumptions and guarantees for the behavior of a cell in the Game of Life. Here is how you would translate the given natural language description into a TSL specification:

```tsl
always assume {
  // comeAlive and comeDead cannot both be true at the same time
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If comeAlive is true, the cell uses changeState() to come alive
  comeAlive(index) -> ([alive <- true]);

  // If comeDead is true, the cell uses changeState() to die
  comeDead(index) -> ([alive <- false]);
}
```

In this specification:
- **Assumptions**: The mutual exclusivity of `comeAlive` and `comeDead` ensures that the logic for cell behavior does not conflict.
- **Guarantees**: The actions to change the state of the cell (`alive`) are directly mapped from the conditions `comeAlive` and `comeDead`. The cell changes its state to alive if `comeAlive(index)` is true, and it changes its state to dead if `comeDead(index)` is true.

This TSL specification effectively models the cell behavior rules of Conway's Game of Life using the predicates provided.
