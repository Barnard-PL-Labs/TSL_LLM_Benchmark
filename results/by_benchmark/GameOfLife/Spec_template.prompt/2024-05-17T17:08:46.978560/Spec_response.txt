Here is the TSL specification that corresponds to the natural language description for simulating a single cell in the game of life:

```tsl
always assume {
  // comeAlive and comeDead are mutually exclusive
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If comeAlive condition is true, then the cell comes alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [changeState(index, alive <- true)];

  // If comeDead condition is true, then the cell dies
  comeDead(index) -> [changeState(index, alive <- false)];
}
```

This specification encapsulates the basic rules of the Game of Life for a single cell, responding to its neighboring cells' states as per the conditions defined by the `comeAlive` and `comeDead` predicates. The cell changes its state using the `changeState` function, which updates the `alive` status based on the conditions evaluated.
