Here is the TSL specification based on your natural language description for a single cell in the Game of Life:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure that comeAlive and comeDead are mutually exclusive
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If comeAlive is true, change the state to alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [alive <- changeState()];
  
  // If comeDead is true, change the state to dead
  comeDead(index) -> [alive <- changeState()];
}
```

In this specification:
- The assumption ensures that the predicates `comeAlive` and `comeDead` cannot both be true at the same time, reflecting the rule that a cell's state change is governed by specific and mutually exclusive conditions.
- The guarantees define the actions taken (changing the state of the cell) based on the results of `comeAlive` and `comeDead`. The function `changeState()` is called to toggle the state of the cell between alive and dead.
