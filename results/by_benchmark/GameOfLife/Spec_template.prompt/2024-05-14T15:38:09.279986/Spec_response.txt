Based on the requirements provided in the natural language description and the rules of Conway's Game of Life, here is how you could write this in TSL. The specification is organized into the `always assume` and `always guarantee` sections as per TSL syntax.

```tsl
always assume {
  // comeAlive and comeDead cannot both be true at the same time
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If comeAlive is true, the cell uses changeState() to come alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [changeState()];

  // If comeDead is true, the cell uses changeState() to die
  comeDead(index) -> [changeState()];
}
```
Explanation:
- **Assumptions Section**: This contains a mutual exclusion condition to ensure that the predicates `comeAlive` and `comeDead` are not true at the same time for the same cell index.
- **Guarantees Section**: This part ensures that if the cell is determined to come alive (`comeAlive(index)` is true), it will trigger the function `changeState()` to change its state to alive. Similarly, if the cell is determined to die (`comeDead(index)` is true), it will also trigger the function `changeState()` to change its state to dead.

This specification is simplified for clarity and focuses on the interaction of a single cell with its conditions for changing states based on the predicates `comeAlive` and `comeDead`.
