Here's the TSL specification for the given natural language description of a cell's behavior in the game of life, utilizing the provided functions and predicates:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensuring that comeAlive and comeDead predicates are mutually exclusive
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If comeAlive is true, the cell changes state to become alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [changeState()];
  
  // If comeDead is true, the cell changes state to die
  comeDead(index) -> [changeState()];
}
```

This TSL specification encapsulates the rules governing the state changes of a cell in Conway's Game of Life, based on the conditions provided by the `comeAlive` and `comeDead` predicates. The mutual exclusivity assumption ensures that the cell does not simultaneously receive conflicting commands to become alive and to die. The guarantees define the specific actions to be taken when each condition is met, utilizing the `changeState` function to toggle the cell's state.
