Here is the TSL specification based on the natural language description provided:

```tsl
always assume {
  // comAlive and comeDead cannot both be true at the same time
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If comeAlive is true, the cell uses changeState() to come alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [changeState()];

  // If comeDead is true, the cell uses changeState() to die
  comeDead(index) -> [changeState()];
}
```

This TSL specification reflects the behavior rules of a cell in the Game of Life, where the cell's life status changes based on the conditions evaluated by the `comeAlive` and `comeDead` predicates, ensuring that both conditions cannot be true simultaneously.
