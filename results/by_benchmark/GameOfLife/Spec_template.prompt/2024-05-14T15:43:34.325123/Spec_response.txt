To translate the description of a single cell in the game of Life into a TSL specification, you need to consider the specific rules that govern the behavior of the cell based on its neighboring cells. Here's how you can write the TSL code according to the given description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensuring that the predicates comeAlive and comeDead cannot both be true at the same time
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If the condition to become alive is met, change the state to alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [changeState(index) <- alive];

  // If the condition to die is met, change the state to dead
  comeDead(index) -> [changeState(index) <- dead];
}
```

Explanation:
- **Assumptions**: We ensure that the predicates `comeAlive` and `comeDead` cannot both be true simultaneously. This is important as it reflects the mutually exclusive nature of these conditions in the game of Life.
  
- **Guarantees**:
  - When `comeAlive` is true, the action to change the state of the cell to alive is invoked. This is modeled by setting the state of cell at `index` to `alive` through the `changeState` function.
  - When `comeDead` is true, the action to change the state of the cell to dead is executed. Similarly, this updates the state of the cell at `index` to `dead` via the `changeState` function.

This TSL specification effectively encapsulates the behavior of a cell in the Game of Life, adhering to the rules that govern whether it should come alive or die based on its neighboring cells.
