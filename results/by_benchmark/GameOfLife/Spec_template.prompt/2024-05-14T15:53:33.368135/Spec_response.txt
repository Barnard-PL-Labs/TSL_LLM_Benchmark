Here's the TSL specification based on the given description and requirements for simulating a single cell in the Game of Life using Temporal Stream Logic (TSL):

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure comeAlive and comeDead cannot both be true at the same time
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If comeAlive is true, change the state of the cell to alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [changeState()];

  // If comeDead is true, change the state of the cell to dead
  comeDead(index) -> [changeState()];
}
```

This TSL specification defines a state machine for a cell that changes its state based on the functions `comeAlive` and `comeDead`. The assumptions ensure that these two conditions cannot be true simultaneously, maintaining the rules of the Game of Life. The guarantees specify the actions to be taken when either condition is met, using the function `changeState()` to change the cell's state accordingly.
