Here is the TSL specification based on the natural language description provided for simulating a single cell in the game of life:

```tsl
always assume {
  // comeAlive and comeDead cannot both be true at the same time
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If comeAlive is true, the cell uses changeState() to come alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [alive <- true];

  // If comeDead is true, the cell uses changeState() to die
  comeDead(index) -> [alive <- false];
}
```

This TSL code captures the behavior of a single cell based on the Game of Life rules, using the `comeAlive` and `comeDead` predicates to determine the cell's next state and applying the `changeState` function to achieve the transition.
