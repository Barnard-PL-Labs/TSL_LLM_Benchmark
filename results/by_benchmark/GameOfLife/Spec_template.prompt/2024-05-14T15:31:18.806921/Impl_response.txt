To implement the Conway's Game of Life logic using JavaScript, we need to first understand how we can interact with the environment based on the provided API. Since the actual API functions are not explicitly mentioned, I will assume the existence of certain basic methods that allow us to query and modify the state of the cells. The API methods we'll assume are:

- `getCell(index)` - Returns the cell object at the given index which can contain properties like whether it is alive.
- `getNeighbors(index)` - Returns an array of neighbor cells for the cell at the given index.
- `setCellState(index, state)` - Sets the state (alive or dead) of the cell at the given index.

Based on these assumptions, we can proceed to implement the required functions and predicates.

### Helper Functions

First, let's create some helper functions to determine the number of live neighbors and to update the state of a cell.

```javascript
// Function to count live neighbors
function countLiveNeighbors(index) {
    let liveCount = 0;
    const neighbors = getNeighbors(index);
    neighbors.forEach(neighbor => {
        if (neighbor.alive) {
            liveCount++;
        }
    });
    return liveCount;
}

// Function to change the state of a cell
function changeState(index, newState) {
    setCellState(index, newState);
}
```

### Predicates

Now, let's implement the predicates based on the rules of Conway's Game of Life.

```javascript
// Predicate to determine if a cell should come alive
function comeAlive(index) {
    const liveNeighbors = countLiveNeighbors(index);
    const cell = getCell(index);
    // A dead cell comes alive if it has exactly 3 live neighbors
    return !cell.alive && liveNeighbors === 3;
}

// Predicate to determine if a cell should come dead
function comeDead(index) {
    const liveNeighbors = countLiveNeighbors(index);
    const cell = getCell(index);
    // A live cell dies if it has fewer than 2 or more than 3 live neighbors
    return cell.alive && (liveNeighbors < 2 || liveNeighbors > 3);
}
```

### Using Predicates and Function

With these predicates and the `changeState` function, you can create a function to update the state of the entire grid, usually called once per tick in the simulation.

```javascript
function updateGrid() {
    const gridLength = getGridSize(); // Assuming this API method exists
    const changes = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < gridLength; i++) {
        if (comeAlive(i)) {
            changes.push({ index: i, state: true });
        } else if (comeDead(i)) {
            changes.push({ index: i, state: false });
        }
    }

    // Apply all changes
    changes.forEach(change => changeState(change.index, change.state));
}
```

This setup ensures that all cells are evaluated before any state changes are made, which is crucial for the correct implementation of Conway's Game of Life. This script will need to be run within an environment that provides the assumed API (`getCell`, `getNeighbors`, `setCellState`, `getGridSize`). 

This code also assumes all indices and neighbor relationships are managed by the API, which isn't detailed here. Adjustments may be needed based on the actual API specifications.
