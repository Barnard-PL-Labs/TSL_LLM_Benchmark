Here's the TSL specification for a single cell simulation in the Game of Life based on your provided functions and predicates, respecting the rules of Conway's Game of Life:

```tsl
always assume {
  // comeAlive and comeDead are mutually exclusive
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If comeAlive is true, then the cell uses changeState() to come alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [ alive <- true ];

  // If comeDead is true, then the cell uses changeState() to die
  comeDead(index) -> [ alive <- false ];
}
```

This specification assumes the correctness and mutual exclusivity of `comeAlive(index)` and `comeDead(index)` predicates, handling the logic to change the state of a cell based on these predicates. The cell's alive status is updated directly based on the result of these conditions, using the `changeState()` function implicitly in the TSL's update syntax.
