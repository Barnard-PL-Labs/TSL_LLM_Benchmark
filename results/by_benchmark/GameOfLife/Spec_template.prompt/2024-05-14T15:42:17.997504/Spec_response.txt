Here's the TSL specification based on your requirements for simulating a single cell in the game of life:

```tsl
always assume {
  // comeAlive and comeDead cannot be true simultaneously
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If comeAlive is true, the cell changes its state to alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [changeState <- alive];

  // If comeDead is true, the cell changes its state to dead
  comeDead(index) -> [changeState <- dead];
}
```

This TSL script sets up the rules for cellular behavior according to the Game of Life rules, ensuring that a cell only comes alive or dies based on the provided predicates `comeAlive` and `comeDead`. Each cell action is dependent on the state determined by these predicates.
