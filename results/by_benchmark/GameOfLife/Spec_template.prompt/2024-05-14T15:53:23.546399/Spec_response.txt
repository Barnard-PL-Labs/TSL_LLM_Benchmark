Based on your description, here is the TSL specification for simulating a single cell in the game of life:

```tsl
always assume {
  // It is assumed that comeAlive and comeDead cannot both be true at the same time
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If comeAlive is true, the cell uses changeState() to come alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [changeState()];

  // If comeDead is true, the cell uses changeState() to die
  comeDead(index) -> [changeState()];
}
```

This specification ensures that the cell changes its state according to the canonical rules of Conway's Game of Life, reacting based on the functions `comeAlive` and `comeDead` that evaluate the cell's environment.
