To translate the given natural language description into a TSL specification for simulating a single cell in the game of life, we need to follow the usual rules of the game and utilize the assumptions and guarantees mentioned. Here's the TSL specification:

```tsl
always assume {
  // comeAlive and comeDead cannot both be true at the same time
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If comeAlive is true, the cell uses changeState() to come alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [alive <- changeState()];

  // If comeDead is true, the cell uses changeState() to die
  comeDead(index) -> [alive <- changeState()];
}
```

This specification ensures that the cell will change its state according to the predefined conditions of "comeAlive" and "comeDead," which are based on the number of its living neighbors. The `changeState()` function is used to toggle the state between alive and dead as per the rules.
