Here is the TSL specification based on the described scenario for a cell in the Game of Life:

```tsl
always assume {
  // comeAlive and comeDead cannot both be true at the same time
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If comeAlive is true, the cell uses changeState() to become alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [changeState()];

  // If comeDead is true, the cell uses changeState() to die
  comeDead(index) -> [changeState()];
}
```

This TSL specification is built to ensure the cell follows the Game of Life rules by changing its state according to the neighbor-based conditions defined in the `comeAlive` and `comeDead` functions. The mutual exclusion assumption makes sure the functions are not true simultaneously, preserving logical consistency.
