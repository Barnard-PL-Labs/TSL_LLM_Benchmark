Here's the TSL specification for the described Game of Life state machine, based on the requirements and assumptions provided:

```tsl
always assume {
  // comeAlive and comeDead cannot both be true at the same time
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If comeAlive is true, the cell uses changeState() to come alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [changeState()];

  // If comeDead is true, the cell uses changeState() to die
  comeDead(index) -> [changeState()];
}
```

This specification ensures that the cell changes state based on the conditions defined by `comeAlive` and `comeDead` functions, adhering to the rules of the Game of Life.
