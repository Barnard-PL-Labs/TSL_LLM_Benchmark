Here is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description and functions for simulating a single cell in the game of life:

```tsl
always assume {
  // comeAlive and comeDead cannot both be true at the same time
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If the comeAlive condition is true, use changeState to make the cell alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [changeState()];

  // If the comeDead condition is true, use changeState to make the cell dead
  comeDead(index) -> [changeState()];
}
```

This TSL code captures the essence of the Game of Life rules for a single cell, using the predicates `comeAlive` and `comeDead` to determine the cell's transitions, and the function `changeState` to change the cell's state accordingly. The assumption ensures that `comeAlive` and `comeDead` cannot both be true at the same time, maintaining the mutual exclusivity required for the correct simulation of the cell's behavior.
