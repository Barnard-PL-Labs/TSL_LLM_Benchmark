Here is how you can translate the requirements for a single cell's behavior in the Game of Life into a TSL specification:

```tsl
always assume {
  // comeAlive and comeDead cannot both be true at the same time
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If comeAlive is true, the cell uses changeState() to come alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [alive <- changeState()];
  
  // If comeDead is true, the cell uses changeState() to die
  comeDead(index) -> [alive <- changeState()];
}
```

This TSL specification reflects the conditions under which a single cell in the Game of Life should change its state based on its neighbors, according to the functions `comeAlive` and `comeDead`. The mutual exclusion of these two functions is assumed, and the corresponding actions to change the state of the cell are guaranteed.
