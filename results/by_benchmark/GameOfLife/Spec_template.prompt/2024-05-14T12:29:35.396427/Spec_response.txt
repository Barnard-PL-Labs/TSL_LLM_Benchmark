Here is the TSL specification for the provided use case of simulating a cell in the Game of Life:

```
always assume {
  // comeAlive and comeDead cannot both be true at the same time
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If comeAlive is true, the cell uses changeState() to come alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [alive <- changeState()];
  
  // If comeDead is true, the cell uses changeState() to die
  comeDead(index) -> [alive <- changeState()];
}
```

This TSL specification defines the behavior of a cell based on the neighbors' state, ensuring that the rules of the Game of Life are respected in terms of cell birth and death based on the defined functions `comeAlive` and `comeDead`.
