Given the natural language description and the requirements for the state machine to simulate a single cell in the game of life, here's how the TSL (Temporal Stream-based Specification Language) specification could be structured:

```
always assume {
  // comeAlive and comeDead predicates cannot both be true at the same time
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If comeAlive is true, the cell uses changeState() to come alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [changeState()];
  
  // If comeDead is true, the cell uses changeState() to die
  comeDead(index) -> [changeState()];
}
```

This TSL code captures the rules of the Game of Life for a single cell by using the provided predicates and function. The assumptions ensure the mutual exclusivity of the conditions for coming alive and dying, while the guarantees define the actions to be taken when these conditions are met.
