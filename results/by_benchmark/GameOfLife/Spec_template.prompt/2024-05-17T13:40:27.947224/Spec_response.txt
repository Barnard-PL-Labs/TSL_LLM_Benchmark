Based on the provided information and the natural language description, we can create a TSL specification for simulating a single cell in the game of life. We will utilize the functions and predicates described to create assumptions and guarantees sections in TSL.

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensuring mutual exclusion of comeAlive and comeDead
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If comeAlive is true, then change the state to alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [changeState()];
  
  // If comeDead is true, then change the state to dead
  comeDead(index) -> [changeState()];
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Assumptions:**
  - The `!(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index))` expression ensures that the `comeAlive` and `comeDead` functions are mutually exclusive, meaning they cannot both be true for the same cell index at the same time.

- **Guarantees:**
  - `comeAlive(index) -> [changeState()];` ensures that if the `comeAlive` function evaluates to true, the cell will change its state to alive using the `changeState()` function.
  - `comeDead(index) -> [changeState()];` similar to the alive condition, when `comeDead` evaluates to true, the state of the cell changes to dead using the `changeState()` function.

This specification directly ties the conditions for a cell to change its state (either becoming alive or dead) based on the defined predicates and ensures that these predicates cannot both hold for any given index at the same time, adhering to the rules of Conway's Game of Life.
