Here's the TSL specification based on the given functions, predicates, and natural language description for simulating a cell in the game of life:

```tsl
always assume {
  // comeAlive and comeDead cannot both be true at the same time
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If comeAlive is true, the cell uses changeState() to come alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [changeState()];

  // If comeDead is true, the cell uses changeState() to die
  comeDead(index) -> [changeState()];
}
```

This TSL specification captures the behavior of a single cell within the Game of Life, responding to its environment by either coming alive or dying based on the number of its neighbors, as determined by the `comeAlive` and `comeDead` predicates.
