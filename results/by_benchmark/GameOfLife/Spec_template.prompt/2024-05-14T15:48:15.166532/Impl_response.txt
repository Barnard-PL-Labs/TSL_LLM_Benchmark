It appears that there might be some confusion in the request. Implementing methods in JavaScript using an API, especially for a scenario like a cellular automaton (which your functions and predicates suggest) doesn't directly relate to a TSL (Temporal Stream Logic) template but rather to actual function implementations. However, I can provide JavaScript implementations for the described functions and predicates assuming a standard grid-based setup typically found in implementations of Conway's Game of Life, which the functions and predicates suggest. 

First, let's establish a JavaScript context for these functions:

1. **Assumptions**:
   - The grid is a 2D array of cells.
   - Each cell in the grid can either be alive (`true`) or dead (`false`).
   - The `index` provided to the `comeAlive` and `comeDead` predicates could be a single integer representing a linearized position of a 2D array, or a pair of coordinates. Here, we'll assume it's a pair `(x, y)` for clarity.

2. **Utility Functions**:
   - **countAliveNeighbors**: This function will help in checking the number of alive neighbors for a given cell.

3. **Predicates and Functions**:
   - **comeAlive**: Checks if a cell should become alive based on the number of its living neighbors.
   - **comeDead**: Checks if a cell should die based on the number of its living neighbors.
   - **changeState**: Toggles the state of a cell in the grid.

Here is a possible implementation:

```javascript
// Assuming gridSize is known and grid is globally accessible 
let grid;
let gridSize;

function initializeGrid(size) {
    gridSize = size;
    grid = Array(size).fill().map(() => Array(size).fill(false));
}

function countAliveNeighbors(x, y) {
    let count = 0;
    for (let dx = -1; dx <= 1; dx++) {
        for (let dy = -1; dy <= 1; dy++) {
            if (dx === 0 && dy === 0) continue;
            let nx = x + dx, ny = y + dy;
            if (nx >= 0 && nx < gridSize && ny >= 0 && ny < gridSize && grid[nx][ny]) {
                count++;
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}

function comeAlive(x, y) {
    const aliveNeighbors = countAliveNeighbors(x, y);
    return (!grid[x][y] && aliveNeighbors === 3) || (grid[x][y] && (aliveNeighbors === 2 || aliveNeighbors === 3));
}

function comeDead(x, y) {
    const aliveNeighbors = countAliveNeighbors(x, y);
    return aliveNeighbors < 2 || aliveNeighbors > 3;
}

function changeState(x, y) {
    grid[x][y] = !grid[x][y];
}


// Initialization of the grid for demonstration
initializeGrid(10); // initialize a 10x10 grid
changeState(1, 1);
changeState(1, 2);
changeState(2, 2);

// Example usage
console.log(`Should (1,2) come alive next generation? ${comeAlive(1, 2)}`);
console.log(`Should (1,1) turn dead next generation? ${comeDead(1, 1)}`);
```

This script sets up a grid, provides a basic implementation of the Conway's Game of Life rules through `comeAlive` and `comeDead` predicates, and allows state toggling through `changeState`. The `initializeGrid`, `comeAlive`, `comeDead`, and `changeState` functions utilize a global `grid` and `gridSize` to manipulate and query cell states based on Conway's Game of Life rules.
