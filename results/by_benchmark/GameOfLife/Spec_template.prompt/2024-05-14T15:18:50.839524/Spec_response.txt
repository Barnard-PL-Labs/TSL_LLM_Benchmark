To translate the given natural language description of a single cell's behavior in the Game of Life into a TSL specification, we can outline as follows:

### TSL Specification

```
always assume {
  // Assumption that comeAlive and comeDead cannot both be true at the same time
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If comeAlive is true, then the cell uses changeState() to come alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [ changeState() ];

  // If comeDead is true, then the cell uses changeState() to die
  comeDead(index) -> [ changeState() ];
}
```

### Explanation

- **Assumptions:** 
  - The assumption section specifies that the predicates `comeAlive(index)` and `comeDead(index)` cannot both be true at the same time. This is expressed using a logical negation of an "and" operation between the two predicates, ensuring mutual exclusivity.

- **Guarantees:** 
  - The guarantees section specifies what actions to take based on the predicates:
    - If `comeAlive(index)` is true, the `changeState()` function is called. This is supposed to make the cell come alive.
    - Similarly, if `comeDead(index)` is true, the `changeState()` function is called. In the context of the game, this should make the cell dead or inactive.

This TSL specification captures the simple logic of a cell's behavior based on its neighbors in the Game of Life, reacting to conditions defined by the `comeAlive` and `comeDead` functions.
