Here's the TSL specification based on the natural language description provided for a single cell in the game of life:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensures that comeAlive and comeDead cannot be true at the same time
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If comeAlive is true for a cell, then changeState() is used to make the cell alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [changeState()];

  // If comeDead is true for a cell, then changeState() is used to make the cell dead
  comeDead(index) -> [changeState()];
}
```

This specification ensures that the cell's state changes according to the rules of the Game of Life, using the provided conditions `comeAlive` and `comeDead` to determine when to change the state.
