Here's the TSL specification based on the description provided for simulating a cell in the game of life:

```tsl
always assume {
  // comAlive and comeDead cannot both be true at the same time
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If comeAlive is true, the cell uses changeState() to come alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [alive <- true];

  // If comeDead is true, the cell uses changeState() to die
  comeDead(index) -> [alive <- false];
}
```

This TSL code snippet ensures that a cell in the game of life updates its state according to the rules given by the functions `comeAlive` and `comeDead`. The assumption ensures that both conditions cannot be true simultaneously, maintaining logical consistency in state transitions.
