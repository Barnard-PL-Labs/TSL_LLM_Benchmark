Here is the TSL specification that corresponds to the natural language description for simulating a single cell in the game of life using the provided functions and predicates:

```tsl
always assume {
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index)); // comeAlive and comeDead cannot both be true at the same time
}

always guarantee {
  comeAlive(index) -> [changeState()]; // If comeAlive is true the cell uses changeState() to come alive
  comeDead(index) -> [changeState()];  // If comeDead is true the cell uses changeState() to die
}
```

This TSL specification includes assumptions and guarantees that align with the rules of the Game of Life for a cell's behavior based on its neighboring cells' states.
