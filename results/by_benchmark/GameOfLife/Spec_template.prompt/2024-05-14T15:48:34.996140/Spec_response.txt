Here is the TSL specification for a single cell in the Game of Life, based on the description provided:

```tsl
always assume {
  // It is assumed that comeAlive and comeDead cannot both be true at the same time
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If comeAlive is true, the cell uses changeState() to come alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [changeState()];
  
  // If comeDead is true, the cell uses changeState() to die
  comeDead(index) -> [changeState()];
}
```

This specification clearly defines the behavior of the cell under the Game of Life rules, where the cell's state transitions are determined by the `comeAlive` and `comeDead` predicates, and the `changeState()` function is called to change the cell's state accordingly.
