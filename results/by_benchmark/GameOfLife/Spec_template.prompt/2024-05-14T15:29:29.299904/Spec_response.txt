To translate the natural language description of a single cell in the game of life into a TSL specification, we'll need to define the assumptions and guarantees based on the provided functions (`comeAlive`, `comeDead`, `changeState`) and predicates. Here's the TSL specification that captures the game's rules:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Assumption that comAlive and comeDead cannot be true simultaneously for any cell
  ! (comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // Guarantee that if comeAlive(index) is true, then the cell uses changeState() to come alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [changeState()];

  // Guarantee that if comeDead(index) is true, then the cell uses changeState() to die
  comeDead(index) -> [changeState()];
}
```

This TSL specification captures the behavior of a single cell in the game of life as described, using the assumed predicates `comeAlive` and `comeDead` to trigger a state change via the function `changeState()`. It ensures that the state change actions are mutually exclusive in concordance with the rules of the game.
