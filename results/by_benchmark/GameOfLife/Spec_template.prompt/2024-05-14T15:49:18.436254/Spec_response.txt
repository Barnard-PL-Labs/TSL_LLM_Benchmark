Here's the TSL specification based on the Game of Life rules and the stated assumptions and guarantees:

```
always assume {
  // comAlive and comeDead cannot both be true at the same time
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If comeAlive is true, the cell uses changeState() to come alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [changeState()];

  // If comeDead is true, the cell uses changeState() to die
  comeDead(index) -> [changeState()];
}
```

This TSL specification captures the basic behavior of a cell in the Game of Life, ensuring that it either comes alive or dies based on the defined predicates `comeAlive` and `comeDead`, and uses the `changeState()` function to switch states accordingly. The mutual exclusion between `comeAlive` and `comeDead` is also maintained as per the assumptions.
