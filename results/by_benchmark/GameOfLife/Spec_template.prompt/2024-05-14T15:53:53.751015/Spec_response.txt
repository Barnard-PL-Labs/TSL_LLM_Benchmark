Here is the TSL specification for simulating a single cell in Conway's Game of Life according to your description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // comeAlive and comeDead cannot both be true at the same time
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If comeAlive returns true, the cell changes its state to alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [changeState()];

  // If comeDead returns true, the cell changes its state to dead
  comeDead(index) -> [changeState()];
}
```

This TSL specification encapsulates the behavior of a single cell in the Game of Life, where the cell's transition rules are determined by the `comeAlive` and `comeDead` predicates, and the action taken (changing state) is specified by the `changeState()` function.
