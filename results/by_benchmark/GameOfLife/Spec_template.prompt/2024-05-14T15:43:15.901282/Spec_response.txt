Here is the TSL specification for simulating a single cell in the Game of Life according to the provided rules and functions:

```TSL
always assume {
  // Either comeAlive(index) or comeDead(index) is true, but not both at the same time
  (comeAlive(index) -> !comeDead(index));
  (comeDead(index) -> !comeAlive(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If comeAlive is true, changeState() is called to make the cell alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [changeState()];

  // If comeDead is true, changeState() is called to make the cell dead
  comeDead(index) -> [changeState()];
}
```

This specification ensures that the cell changes its state appropriately based on the predicates `comeAlive` and `comeDead`, which are assumed to be mutually exclusive and determine whether the cell comes alive or dies during each step of the simulation.
