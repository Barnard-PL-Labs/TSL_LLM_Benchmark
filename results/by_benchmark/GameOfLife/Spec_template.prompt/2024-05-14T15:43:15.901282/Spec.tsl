always assume {
  // Either comeAlive(index) or comeDead(index) is true, but not both at the same time
  (comeAlive(index) -> !comeDead(index));
  (comeDead(index) -> !comeAlive(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If comeAlive is true, changeState() is called to make the cell alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [changeState()];

  // If comeDead is true, changeState() is called to make the cell dead
  comeDead(index) -> [changeState()];
