```
always assume {
  // Ensure `comeAlive` and `comeDead` are mutually exclusive
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If `comeAlive` is true, the cell changes state to alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [changeState()];

  // If `comeDead` is true, the cell changes state to die
  comeDead(index) -> [changeState()];
}
```
