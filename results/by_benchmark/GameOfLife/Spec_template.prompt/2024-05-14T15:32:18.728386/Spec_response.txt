To translate the provided natural language description for a single cell in the game of life into TSL, we need to define the assumptions and guarantees that match the defined rules of the game. Here's how the TSL specification could look:

```tsl
always assume {
  // comeAlive and comeDead cannot both be true at the same time
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If comeAlive condition is true, then change the state of the cell to alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [changeState()];
  
  // If comeDead condition is true, then change the state of the cell to dead
  comeDead(index) -> [changeState()];
}
```

In this TSL code:

- The `always assume` block ensures that the predicates `comeAlive` and `comeDead` cannot both be true at the same time, reflecting the mutual exclusivity of these conditions for a cell in the game of life.

- The `always guarantee` block dictates the actions of the cell based on the predicates `comeAlive` and `comeDead`. If `comeAlive(index)` returns true, the cell's state is changed to alive using the function `changeState()`. Similarly, if `comeDead(index)` returns true, the state of the cell is changed to dead, also using `changeState()`. This reflects the rule that the cell reacts to its environment by changing state based on the number of alive neighbors it has.
