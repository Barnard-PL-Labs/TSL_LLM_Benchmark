Here is the TSL specification based on your description for simulating a single cell in the game of life using the provided predicates and functions:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Mutual exclusion between comAlive and comeDead
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If comeAlive condition is true, the cell changes its state to alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [changeState()];

  // If comeDead condition is true, the cell changes its state to dead
  comeDead(index) -> [changeState()];
}
```

This TSL code assumes that the `comeAlive(index)` and `comeDead(index)` predicates accurately reflect the rules of the Game of Life for a cell based on its neighbors. The mutual exclusion in the assumptions ensures that a cell cannot simultaneously be commanded to come alive and die. The guarantee specifies the actions to be taken when either of these conditions is true.
