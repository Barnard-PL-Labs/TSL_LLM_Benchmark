Here is the TSL specification based on the description provided for simulating a cell in the game of life using the predicates and functions:

```tsl
always assume {
  // comeAlive and comeDead cannot both be true at the same time
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If comeAlive is true, the cell uses changeState() to come alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [changeState()];

  // If comeDead is true, the cell uses changeState() to die
  comeDead(index) -> [changeState()];
}
```

This TSL specification correctly translates the natural language description into the formal temporal structured language, ensuring the cell behaves according to the rules of the game of life, changing its state based on the conditions provided by `comeAlive` and `comeDead`.
