Here is the TSL specification based on the description and the rules of the Game of Life for a single cell:

```tsl
always assume {
  // comeAlive and comeDead cannot both be true at the same time
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If comeAlive is true, the cell uses changeState() to come alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [ alive <- true ];

  // If comeDead is true, the cell uses changeState() to die
  comeDead(index) -> [ alive <- false ];
}
```

This specification manages the basic rules of the Game of Life regarding cell transition between alive and dead states based on the predefined predicates `comeAlive` and `comeDead`. It ensures that these predicates are mutually exclusive and applies the appropriate state change using the function `changeState` by setting the value of `alive`.
