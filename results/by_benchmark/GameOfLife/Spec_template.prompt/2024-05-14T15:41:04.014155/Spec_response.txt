Here is the TSL (Temporal Stream Logic) specification for the described single cell simulation in the Game of Life, based on the provided functions and predicates:

```tsl
always assume {
  // comAlive and comeDead cannot both be true at the same time
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If comeAlive(index) is true the cell uses changeState() to come alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [alive <- true];

  // If comeDead(index) is true the cell uses changeState() to die
  comeDead(index) -> [alive <- false];
}
```

In this TSL specification:
- The `always assume` block ensures that the conditions `comeAlive` and `comeDead` cannot both be true simultaneously, maintaining the logical consistency of the cell's state transitions according to the rules.
  
- The `always guarantee` block enforces that the cellâ€™s alive state is updated based on the `comeAlive` and `comeDead` predicates. If `comeAlive(index)` evaluates as true, the cell's alive state is set to true (the cell comes alive). Conversely, if `comeDead(index)` evaluates as true, the cell's alive state is set to false (the cell dies).
