Here's the TSL specification for the Game of Life scenario described:

```tsl
always assume {
  // comeAlive and comeDead cannot both be true at the same time
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If comeAlive is true, the cell uses changeState() to come alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [changeState(index)];

  // If comeDead is true, the cell uses changeState() to die
  comeDead(index) -> [changeState(index)];
}
```

In this specification:
- The assumption ensures mutual exclusivity between `comeAlive` and `comeDead`, meaning the scenarios they represent cannot happen simultaneously.
- The guarantees describe the actions to be taken if `comeAlive` or `comeDead` predicates are true, which is to invoke the `changeState` function to update the cell's state appropriately. Since `changeState` is meant to toggle the state of the cell, it's suitable for both coming alive and dying based on the condition specified.
