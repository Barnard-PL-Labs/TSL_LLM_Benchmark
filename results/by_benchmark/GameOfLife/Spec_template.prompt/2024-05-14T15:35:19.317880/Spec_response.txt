Here is the TSL specification that represents a state machine for a single cell in the game of life based on the natural language description and the given assumptions and guarantees:

```tsl
always assume {
  // comeAlive and comeDead are mutually exclusive
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // when comeAlive is true, the cell state changes to alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [alive <- true];

  // when comeDead is true, the cell state changes to dead
  comeDead(index) -> [alive <- false];
}
```
