Based on the information provided and the natural language description for simulating a cell in the game of life, here is the corresponding TSL specification:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure that comeAlive and comeDead are not both true at the same time
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If comeAlive is true, the cell should change state to become alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [ changeState() ];

  // If comeDead is true, the cell should change state to die
  comeDead(index) -> [ changeState() ];
}
```

This TSL specification captures the logic for a single cell's behavior in Conway's Game of Life, based on your assumptions and guarantees. The `changeState()` function toggles the cell's state between alive and dead according to the predicates `comeAlive` and `comeDead`.
