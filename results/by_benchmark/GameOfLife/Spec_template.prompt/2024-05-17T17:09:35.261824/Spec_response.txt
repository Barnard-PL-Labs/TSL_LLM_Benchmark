Here's how you would translate your natural language description for a single cell in the Game of Life into a TSL specification:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensuring that comeAlive and comeDead predicates are not both true at the same time
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If comeAlive is true, the cell changes its state to alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [changeState()];

  // If comeDead is true, the cell changes its state to dead
  comeDead(index) -> [changeState()];
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Assumptions**:
    - The assumption states that the predicates `comeAlive(index)` and `comeDead(index)` cannot both be true at the same time. This aligns with the rules of the Game of Life where a cell's next state is determined based on a specific set of conditions, and conflicting conditions (both alive and dead) should not occur simultaneously.

2. **Guarantees**:
    - The guarantees ensure that if the cell should come alive according to the `comeAlive` predicate, then the cell uses the function `changeState()` to become alive.
    - Similarly, if the cell should die according to the `comeDead` predicate, then the cell uses the function `changeState()` to die.

This TSL specification effectively models the behavior of a single cell in the Game of Life based on the rules defined by the `comeAlive` and `comeDead` functions.
