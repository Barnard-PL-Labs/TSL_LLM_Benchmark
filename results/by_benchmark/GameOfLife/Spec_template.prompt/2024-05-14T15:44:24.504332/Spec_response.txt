Here's the TSL specification based on your description that models the behavior of a single cell in the Game of Life:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure that comeAlive and comeDead are mutually exclusive
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If comeAlive is true, the cell must change its state to alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [changeState()];

  // If comeDead is true, the cell must change its state to dead
  comeDead(index) -> [changeState()];
}
```

This TSL specification reflects the rules of Conway's Game of Life at the level of an individual cell, responding to the predicates `comeAlive` and `comeDead` to change state as necessary. These predicates are assumed to correctly encapsulate the logic for determining whether a cell should become alive or dead based on its neighbors. The `changeState()` function is used to switch the state of the cell from alive to dead or vice versa.
