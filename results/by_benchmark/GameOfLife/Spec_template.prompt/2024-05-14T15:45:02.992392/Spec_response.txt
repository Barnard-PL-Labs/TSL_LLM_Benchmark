To translate the provided natural language description into a TSL specification that simulates a cell in Conway's Game of Life, you need to accurately represent the rules governing cell behavior based on its neighbors. Below is the TSL specification based on the description and rules provided:

```tsl
always assume {
  // `comeAlive(index)` and `comeDead(index)` are mutually exclusive
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If `comeAlive(index)` is true, the cell uses `changeState()` to come alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [changeState()];

  // If `comeDead(index)` is true, the cell uses `changeState()` to die
  comeDead(index) -> [changeState()];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions:**
   - We assume that the predicates `comeAlive(index)` and `comeDead(index)` cannot be true at the same time. This models the logic that a cell cannot simultaneously be in the process of coming alive and dying based on its neighbors.

2. **Guarantees:**
   - The `comeAlive(index)` predicate, when true, triggers the cell to come alive. This is done by executing the `changeState()` function.
   - Similarly, the `comeDead(index)` predicate, when true, triggers the cell to die, also via the `changeState()` function.

This TSL specification captures the essential rules of Conway's Game of Life for a single cell, based on its interactions with neighbors, which determine whether it comes alive or dies in each step of the simulation.
