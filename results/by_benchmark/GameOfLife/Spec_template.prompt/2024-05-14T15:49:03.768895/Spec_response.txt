Here's how the TSL template for simulating a single cell in the Game of Life might look based on the provided rules and functions:

```tsl
always assume {
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index)); // comeAlive and comeDead cannot both be true at the same time
}

always guarantee {
  comeAlive(index) -> [changeState()];
  comeDead(index) -> [changeState()];
}
```

This TSL specification respects the natural language description and includes all necessary details to ensure the cell behaves according to the stated rules of the Game of Life. Each function's effects are guaranteed based on the state determined by the comeAlive and comeDead predicates.
