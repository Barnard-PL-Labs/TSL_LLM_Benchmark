Below is a TSL specification that captures the behavior of a cell in the Game of Life based on the provided functions and predicates, adhering to the rules and constraints given:

```tsl
always assume {
  // comeAlive and comeDead cannot both be true at the same time
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If comeAlive is true, the cell uses changeState() to come alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [changeState()];

  // If comeDead is true, the cell uses changeState() to die
  comeDead(index) -> [changeState()];
}
```

This specification leverages the TSL language's capabilities to define when a cell should change its state based on the predicates `comeAlive` and `comeDead`. Each predicate triggers a distinct action captured by the `changeState()` function, which is executed under the conditions specified.
