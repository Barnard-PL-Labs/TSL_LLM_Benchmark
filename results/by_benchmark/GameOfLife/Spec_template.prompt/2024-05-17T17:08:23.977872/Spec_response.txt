Here's the TSL specification based on your description for simulating a single cell in the game of life:

```tsl
always assume {
  // comeAlive and comeDead are mutually exclusive
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If comeAlive is true, the cell changes state to alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [changeState <- alive];

  // If comeDead is true, the cell changes state to dead
  comeDead(index) -> [changeState <- dead];
}
```

This TSL code segment ensures that the game of life rules for a single cell are maintained, based on the assumptions about the conditions under which a cell comes alive or dies.
