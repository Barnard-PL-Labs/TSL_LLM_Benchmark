It looks like your message got cut off before you could detail the specific System API functions and behaviors, so I'll base the implementation on assumptions common in cellular automata, specifically like the Game of Life.

### JavaScript Implementation Overview

We will assume that the System API provides a way to check the status of a cell (alive or dead) and a way to change the state of a cell. Functions will also need to determine the number of living neighbors for a given cell to decide whether it should come alive or become dead based on the rules similar to Conway's Game of Life.

Let's define the following:
1. **changeState(index)** - function that toggles the state of a cell at a given index.
2. **comeAlive(index)** - predicate that returns true if a cell at the given index should become alive based on its neighbors.
3. **comeDead(index)** - predicate that returns true if a cell at the given index should become dead.

We'll also need helper functions to calculate the number of living neighbors and to determine the indices of those neighbors.

```javascript
// Assumed API functions (need to be adapted to actual API names and signatures)
function apiIsCellAlive(index) {
  // Returns if the cell at the provided index is alive.
}

function apiChangeCellState(index) {
  // Toggles the state of the cell (alive/dead) at the provided index.
}

function getNeighborIndices(index) {
  // This should return an array of indices that represent the neighbors of
  // the cell at 'index'. Implement according to the grid topology and size.
  // Example for a grid where width = W:
  // return [
  //   index - W - 1, index - W, index - W + 1,
  //   index - 1,                 index + 1,
  //   index + W - 1, index + W, index + W + 1
  // ].filter(i => i >= 0 && i < totalCells); // Ensure indices are valid
}

function countLivingNeighbors(index) {
  const neighbors = getNeighborIndices(index);
  return neighbors.reduce((count, idx) => count + (apiIsCellAlive(idx) ? 1 : 0), 0);
}

// Predicate: Check if cell at 'index' should come alive
function comeAlive(index) {
  const livingNeighbors = countLivingNeighbors(index);
  return livingNeighbors === 3 || (apiIsCellAlive(index) && livingNeighbors === 2);
}

// Predicate: Check if cell at 'index' should become dead
function comeDead(index) {
  const livingNeighbors = countLivingNeighbors(index);
  return livingNeighbors < 2 || livingNeighbors > 3;
}

// Function: Change the state of the cell based on the predicates
function changeState(index) {
  if (comeAlive(index) && !apiIsCellAlive(index)) {
    apiChangeCellState(index);
  } else if (comeDead(index) && apiIsCellAlive(index)) {
    apiChangeCellState(index);
  }
}
```

### Important Notes:

1. **Grid Topology**: The neighbors calculation assumes a simple grid. You should adapt this according to whether the grid wraps (toroidal) or has hard borders. You also need to consider the grid's dimensions (width, height).
2. **API Functions**: The names `apiIsCellAlive` and `apiChangeCellState` are placeholders. Replace these with the actual function names provided by your environment's API.
3. **Edge Cases**: Make sure your implementation handles cells at the edges of the grid correctly, which might have fewer neighbors than those centrally located.
