It appears that you're describing a system akin to Conway's Game of Life, where cells on a grid can either be alive or dead, and their states change based on the number of living neighbors they have. To implement this using JavaScript, I'll also need to assume certain behaviors and structure of your system API, as that part seems to be truncated or incomplete in your message.

Here’s a JavaScript implementation for the required functions and predicates, assuming each cell’s state (alive or dead) is represented in a 2D array:

```javascript
// Constants for cell states
const DEAD = 0;
const ALIVE = 1;

// The grid representing the cells
const grid = [
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
  [0, 1, 1, 1, 0],
  [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
];

// Function to count the alive neighbors of a cell
function countAliveNeighbors(x, y) {
  let count = 0;
  for (let dx = -1; dx <= 1; dx++) {
    for (let dy = -1; dy <= 1; dy++) {
      if (dx === 0 && dy === 0) continue; // Skip the cell itself
      const nx = x + dx;
      const ny = y + dy;
      if (nx >= 0 && nx < grid.length && ny >= 0 && ny < grid[0].length) {
        if (grid[nx][ny] === ALIVE) count++;
      }
    }
  }
  return count;
}

// Predicate to check if a cell should come alive based on its neighbors
function comeAlive(x, y) {
  const aliveNeighbors = countAliveNeighbors(x, y);
  return (grid[x][y] === DEAD && aliveNeighbors === 3) ||
         (grid[x][y] === ALIVE && (aliveNeighbors === 2 || aliveNeighbors === 3));
}

// Predicate to check if a cell should die based on its neighbors
function comeDead(x, y) {
  const aliveNeighbors = countAliveNeighbors(x, y);
  return aliveNeighbors < 2 || aliveNeighbors > 3;
}

// Function to change the state of the grid
function changeState() {
  const newState = grid.map(row => row.slice());
  for (let x = 0; x < grid.length; x++) {
    for (let y = 0; y < grid[x].length; y++) {
      if (comeAlive(x, y)) {
        newState[x][y] = ALIVE;
      } else if (comeDead(x, y)) {
        newState[x][y] = DEAD;
      }
    }
  }
  return newState;
}

// Example usage
console.log("Initial State:");
console.log(grid);
console.log("New State:");
console.log(changeState());
```

### Notes:

1. **Grid Representation**: The `grid` variable represents the game's board. Each cell is either `0` (dead) or `1` (alive).
2. **Neighbor Counting**: The `countAliveNeighbors` function computes how many living neighbors a cell has.
3. **Life Cycle Conditions**: The `comeAlive` and `comeDead` functions implement the rules for a cell transitioning to live or dead state.
4. **State Transition**: The `changeState` function computes the next state of the grid based on the current state.

This implementation assumes a finite grid without wrapping at the edges. Adjustments could be made for different grid behaviors (like toroidal wrapping) as needed.
