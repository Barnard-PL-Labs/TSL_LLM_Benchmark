Below is the TSL specification for simulating a single cell in the Game of Life based on the provided functions and predicates, along with the rules of the game:

```tsl
always assume {
  // comeAlive and comeDead cannot both be true at the same time
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If comeAlive is true then the cell uses changeState() to come alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [alive <- changeState()];

  // If comeDead is true then the cell uses changeState() to die
  comeDead(index) -> [alive <- changeState()];
}
```

This TSL specification accurately reflects the natural language description and adheres to the rules of the Game of Life, ensuring that the cell changes state according to the predicates `comeAlive` and `comeDead`.
