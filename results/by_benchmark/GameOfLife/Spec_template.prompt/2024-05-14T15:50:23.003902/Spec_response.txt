Given the information and the requirements, here's how you can translate the rules of the game of life for a single cell into a TSL specification:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Assures that comeAlive and comeDead predicates cannot both be true at the same time
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If comeAlive is true, the cell uses changeState() to come alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [changeState()];

  // If comeDead is true, the cell uses changeState() to die
  comeDead(index) -> [changeState()];
}
```

This specification assumes that the cell in question only changes state (i.e., from dead to alive or from alive to dead) based on the `comeAlive` or `comeDead` predicates. These predicates are expected to be evaluated based on the cell's neighbors, though those conditions are abstracted away in the predicates themselves and not explicitly modeled in this TSL specification.
