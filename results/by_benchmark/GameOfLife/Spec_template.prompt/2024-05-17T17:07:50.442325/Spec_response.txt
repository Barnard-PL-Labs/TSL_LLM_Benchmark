Below is the TSL specification that follows the requirements mentioned in the natural language description for simulating a single cell in the game of life. The specification leverages the functions and predicates provided.

```tsl
always assume {
  // comeAlive and comeDead cannot both be true at the same time
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If comeAlive is true, the cell uses changeState() to become alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [changeState()];

  // If comeDead is true, the cell uses changeState() to die
  comeDead(index) -> [changeState()];
}
```

In this specification:
- The `always assume` block ensures that `comeAlive` and `comeDead` cannot be true at the same time, which aligns with the natural language description.
- The `always guarantee` block guarantees that the cell will change its state based on the conditions defined by `comeAlive` and `comeDead`. Since the function `changeState` is used both for becoming alive and dying, it is assumed to toggle the current state of the cell appropriately depending on the predicate conditions.
