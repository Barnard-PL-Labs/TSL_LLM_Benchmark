To implement the function `updateState` in JavaScript for simulating a single cell in the Game of Life, you can follow these steps based on the provided description. This function will utilize the predicates `comeAlive` and `comeDead` to determine whether the cell should be alive or dead in the next state. Hereâ€™s how you can structure the function:

```javascript
function updateState({ currentState, index }) {
    // newState is used to store the cell's next state, which will either be alive (true) or dead (false).
    let newState = currentState;

    // Check if the cell should come alive based on the comeAlive predicate.
    if (comeAlive(index)) {
        newState = true; // The cell becomes alive.
        changeState(newState); // Apply the state change.
    }
    // Check if the cell should become dead based on the comeDead predicate.
    else if (comeDead(index)) {
        newState = false; // The cell becomes dead.
        changeState(newState); // Apply the state change.
    }

    // Return the updated state of the cell. Here the output structure includes the new state of "alive".
    return {
        currentState: newState,
        alive: newState,
        index: index
    };
}

// Helper functions (assumed to be given as part of the environment)
function comeAlive(index) {
    // This function is expected to return true if the cell at `index` should become alive.
    // Implementation details depend on the environment and are not provided here.
}

function comeDead(index) {
    // This function is expected to return true if the cell at `index` should die.
    // Implementation details depend on the environment and are not provided here.
}

function changeState(newState) {
    // This function is expected to change the state of the cell to the new state (alive or dead).
    // Implementation details depend on the environment and are not provided here.
}
```

### Explanation

- **Function Parameters**: The function accepts an object containing `currentState` and `index`. The `currentState` indicates whether the cell is currently alive or dead. The `index` represents the position of the cell, which is used by the predicates `comeAlive` and `comeDead` to determine the cell's neighbors' states.
- **Logic**: The function first checks if the cell should come alive (`comeAlive(index)` returns true), then it sets `newState` to true and applies the state change using `changeState()`. If `comeAlive` is false, it then checks if the cell should die using `comeDead(index)`. If true, it sets `newState` to false and calls `changeState()`.
- **Return Value**: The function returns an object with the updated `currentState` along with the `alive` status and the `index`. This ensures that the output format is clear and maintains consistency with the input structure.
- **Helper Functions**: `comeAlive`, `comeDead`, and `changeState` are helper functions assumed to be available in the environment, per the problem description. Their implementations are dependent on the specifics of the Game of Life simulation environment and are not explicitly defined here.
