To translate the given natural language description into a JavaScript function, we'll implement the rules of Conway's Game of Life for a single cell. This involves checking whether a cell should come alive or die based on its neighboring cells, which is determined by the predicates `comeAlive` and `comeDead`.

Given the structure of the function and the requirement, here is the JavaScript implementation that simulates a state update for a single cell in the Game of Life:

```javascript
function updateState({ currentState, index, alive }) {
    // Determine if the cell should come alive
    if (comeAlive(index)) {
        // If the predicate comeAlive returns true, change the state of the cell to alive
        currentState = changeState(true); // Assuming changeState(true) sets the cell's state to alive
        alive = true;
    } else if (comeDead(index)) {
        // If the predicate comeDead returns true, change the state of the cell to dead
        currentState = changeState(false); // Assuming changeState(false) sets the cell's state to dead
        alive = false;
    }

    // Return the updated state along with any other properties that need to be maintained
    return { currentState, alive, index };
}

// Helper functions for the sake of completeness (definitions should be based on actual implementation details)
function comeAlive(index) {
    // Implementation based on the Game of Life rules
    // Should return true if exactly 3 neighbors are alive, or if the cell is currently alive and has 2 or 3 living neighbors
    // Needs access to the grid or state array to count neighbors
}

function comeDead(index) {
    // Implementation based on the Game of Life rules
    // Should return true if the cell has fewer than 2 or more than 3 living neighbors
    // Needs access to the grid or state array to count neighbors
}

function changeState(isAlive) {
    // Change the state of the cell to either alive or dead based on isAlive
    return isAlive; // This function might interact with a global or external state management system
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Structure**: The function `updateState` accepts an object containing `currentState`, `index`, and `alive` which represent the current state of the cell, its index in the grid, and whether it is alive, respectively.

2. **Logic Implementation**: It uses two predicates:
   - `comeAlive(index)`: Determines if a cell should become alive based on the Game of Life rules.
   - `comeDead(index)`: Determines if a cell should die based on the Game of Life rules.

3. **State Change**: Based on these predicates, the function either makes the cell alive or dead using the hypothetical `changeState` function, which is assumed to modify the cell's state directly or indirectly.

4. **Return State**: The function returns the new state of the cell, including any other properties (`alive`, `index`) that need to be persisted.

This setup presumes that the surrounding environment or other functions (`comeAlive`, `comeDead`, `changeState`) handle specifics like interacting with the grid or additional state management. These would be dependent on the broader application architecture in which this function operates.
