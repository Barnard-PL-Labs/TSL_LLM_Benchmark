Below is the TSL specification that simulates a single cell in the game of life according to the rules you've described:

```
always assume {
  // Assuming the behavior of the predicates provided and the grid context
  (alive && comeAlive(index)) || (!alive && comeAlive(index));
  (alive && comeDead(index)) || (!alive && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If the cell is alive and the conditions to remain alive are met, keep the state
  (alive && comeAlive(index)) -> [changeState <- alive];

  // If the cell is dead and the conditions to come alive are met, change state to alive
  (!alive && comeAlive(index)) -> [changeState <- alive];

  // If the cell is alive and the conditions to die are met, change state to dead
  (alive && comeDead(index)) -> [changeState <- dead];

  // If the cell is dead and the conditions to remain dead are met, keep the state
  (!alive && comeDead(index)) -> [changeState <- dead];
}
```

This specification tracks the life state of a single cell, using predicates `comeAlive` and `comeDead` to determine if the cell should change its state or maintain its current state. It leverages the `changeState` function to enact these state transitions.
