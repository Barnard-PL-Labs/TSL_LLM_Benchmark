Here is the TSL specification for the Game of Life simulation for a single cell:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Define the conditions under which a cell comes alive or dies
  (alive -> comeAlive(index)) || (!alive -> comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If a cell is supposed to come alive, change its state to alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [alive <- true];
  
  // If a cell is supposed to die, change its state to dead
  comeDead(index) -> [alive <- false];
  
  // If neither condition is met, the state of the cell remains unchanged
  !(comeAlive(index) || comeDead(index)) -> [alive <- alive];
}
```

This specification uses the given predicates `comeAlive(index)` and `comeDead(index)` to determine the state transitions of a cell based on its neighbors. The `changeState` function is assumed to be encompassed within the actions `[alive <- true]` and `[alive <- false]`, effectively changing the state of the cell in response to the rules defined by the predicates.
