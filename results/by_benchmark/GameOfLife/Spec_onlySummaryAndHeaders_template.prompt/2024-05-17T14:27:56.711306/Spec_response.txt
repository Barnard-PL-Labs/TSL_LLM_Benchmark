Here's the TSL specification based on the description provided for simulating a single cell in the game of life:

```tsl
always assume {
  // The basic assumption of cell state transitions depends on the number of active neighbors
  (alive && comeAlive(index)) || (!alive && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If the cell should come alive, change its state to alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [changeState <- true];

  // If the cell should die, change its state to dead
  comeDead(index) -> [changeState <- false];
}
```

In this TSL specification:
- The `always assume` block contains the core assumption that the cell changes based on the number of living neighbors, adhering to the rules of Conway's Game of Life.
- The `always guarantee` block specifies the behavior (changing state) based on whether the cell needs to come alive or die according to the predicates `comeAlive` and `comeDead`. The function `changeState` is used to toggle the cell's state between alive and dead.
