Here is the TSL specification for simulating a single cell in the game of life based on the provided functions and predicates:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Assumption about the life conditions related to neighbors of a cell
  (comeAlive(index) -> (alive || !alive)) ;
  (comeDead(index) -> (alive || !alive)) ;
}

always guarantee {
  // Guarantee that the cell changes state according to the game of life rules
  comeAlive(index) && !alive -> [changeState()];  // If the cell should come alive and it's currently dead, change its state
  comeDead(index) && alive -> [changeState()]; // If the cell should die and it's currently alive, change its state
}
```

In this specification:
- The `assume` block describes possible conditions a cell might satisfy based on its neighbors â€” either coming alive or becoming dead.
- The `guarantee` block enforces that the cell changes its state accurately:
  - If predicated by `comeAlive(index)` (where exactly 3 neighbours are living or 2 or 3 neighbours are living) and the cell is currently dead, it will change state to alive.
  - If predicted by `comeDead(index)` (where the cell has less than 2 or more than 3 neighbours) and the cell is currently alive, it will change state to dead. 

This setup ensures that each cell updates its status according to the classical rules of Conway's Game of Life.
