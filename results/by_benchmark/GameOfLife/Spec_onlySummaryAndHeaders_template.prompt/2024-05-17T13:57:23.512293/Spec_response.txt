To create a TSL specification for a single cell in the Game of Life, we need to translate the basic rules governing the cell's behavior based on its neighbors' states. Here's the TSL code that would implement such a state machine:

```tsl
always assume {
  // No explicit assumptions needed for this particular model
  // Assume that the environment will correctly provide the number of living neighbors
}

always guarantee {
  // If the cell is alive, check if it should become dead
  alive && comeDead(index) -> [changeState(index) <- false];

  // If the cell is dead, check if it should come alive
  !alive && comeAlive(index) -> [changeState(index) <- true];

  // If none of the conditions to change state are met, maintain current state
  (alive && !comeDead(index)) -> [changeState(index) <- true];
  (!alive && !comeAlive(index)) -> [changeState(index) <- false];
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Assumptions**: This section commonly describes the environmental inputs or conditions that the system can assume to hold. For this model of a single cell in the Game of Life, we assume that the neighbor counts (which dictate whether `comeAlive(index)` or `comeDead(index)` predicates are true) are accurately provided by the environment. 

2. **Guarantees**: These are the rules or assertions the system must ensure.
   - If a cell is currently alive (`alive`) and the conditions to become dead are met (`comeDead(index)`), then the system should guarantee that the cell's state is changed to dead (`[changeState(index) <- false]`).
   - Conversely, if a cell is dead (`!alive`) and the conditions for it to come alive are met (`comeAlive(index)`), it should be revived (`[changeState(index) <- true]`).
   - If a cell is alive and should not die, or if it's dead and should not come alive, its state remains unchanged. This ensures stability in the cell's state unless a rule explicitly triggers a change.

This specification models each individual cell's behavior based on the classic Game of Life rules, reacting to its immediate environment's state changes, particularly the number of live neighbors.
