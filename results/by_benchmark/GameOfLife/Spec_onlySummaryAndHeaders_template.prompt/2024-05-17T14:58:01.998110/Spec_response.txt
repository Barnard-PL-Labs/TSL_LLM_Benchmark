To translate the given natural language description into a TSL specification for simulating a single cell in the game of life, we must consider the classic rules of the game:

1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.
2. Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

Here's how you might write these rules in TSL:

```TSL
always assume {
  (alive && comeAlive(index)); // if the cell is alive, it should have exactly 2 or 3 live neighbors to stay alive
  (!alive && comeAlive(index)); // if the cell is dead, it should have exactly 3 live neighbors to become alive
  (alive && comeDead(index)); // if the cell is alive and has less than 2 or more than 3 neighbors, it will die
  (!alive && comeDead(index)); // if the cell is dead and has less than 2 or more than 3 neighbors, it stays dead
}

always guarantee {
  (alive && comeAlive(index)) -> [changeState(index) <- alive]; // if alive and conditions met, remains alive
  (!alive && comeAlive(index)) -> [changeState(index) <- alive]; // if dead and conditions met, becomes alive
  (alive && comeDead(index)) -> [changeState(index) <- !alive]; // if alive and conditions met, becomes dead
  (!alive && comeDead(index)) -> [changeState(index) <- !alive]; // if dead and conditions met, stays dead
}
```

In this TSL specification:

- The `assume` block defines conditions based on the status of the cell (alive or not) and its interaction with its neighbors, according to the rules of the game of life.
- The `guarantee` block specifies the actions to be taken (changing the state of the cell to alive or dead) based on the conditions stipulated in the `assume` block.

This specification ensures that the cell's state transitions correctly mimic the behavior expected in Conway's Game of Life according to its standard rules.
