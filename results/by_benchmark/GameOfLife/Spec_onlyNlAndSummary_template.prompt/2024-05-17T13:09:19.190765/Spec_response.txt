Here is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description for simulating a single cell in the game of life:

```tsl
always assume {
  // comeAlive and comeDead cannot both be true at the same time
  !(comeAlive && comeDead);
}

always guarantee {
  // If comeAlive is true the cell uses changeState() to come alive
  comeAlive -> [cellState <- changeState(alive)];

  // If comeDead is true the cell uses changeState() to die
  comeDead -> [cellState <- changeState(dead)];
}
```
