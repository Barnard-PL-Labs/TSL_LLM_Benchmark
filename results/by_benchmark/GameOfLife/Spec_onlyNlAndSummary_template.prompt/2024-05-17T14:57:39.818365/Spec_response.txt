Here is the TSL specification based on your description for simulating a single cell in the game of life:

```tsl
always assume {
  !(comeAlive && comeDead); // comeAlive and comeDead cannot both be true at the same time
}

always guarantee {
  comeAlive -> [changeState <- alive]; // If comeAlive is true, the cell comes alive
  comeDead -> [changeState <- dead]; // If comeDead is true, the cell dies
}
```
