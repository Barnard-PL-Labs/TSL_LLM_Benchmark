From the description, I'll assume a basic system API involves managing cells in a grid system, typically found in implementations like Conway's Game of Life. The goal is to implement JavaScript functions and predicates to interact with such an environment. Here, we need to implement functions to change the state of a cell and predicates to determine whether cells should come alive or go dead based on the number of living neighbors.

Given the context, we'd usually manage cells in a two-dimensional grid, and each cell's state is either alive or dead. The neighbors of a cell are the adjacent cells in horizontal, vertical, and diagonal directions.

### Helper Functions

Before implementing the required functions and predicates, let's define some helper functions to manage the grid and determine the state of the cells:

```javascript
// Assume a grid setup where the grid is a 2D array of boolean values
// grid[row][col] = true if alive, false if dead
const grid = [];

// Function to get the number of living neighbors for a given cell
function countLivingNeighbors(grid, row, col) {
    const rows = grid.length;
    const cols = grid[0].length;
    let count = 0;
    
    for (let i = -1; i <= 1; i++) {
        for (let j = -1; j <= 1; j++) {
            if (i === 0 && j === 0) continue; // Skip the cell itself
            const r = row + i;
            const c = col + j;
            if (r >= 0 && r < rows && c >= 0 && c < cols && grid[r][c]) {
                count++;
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

### Implementation of Required Functions and Predicates

With the helper function ready, we can implement the required functions and predicates:

```javascript
// Function to change the state of a cell
function changeState(index, newState) {
    const row = Math.floor(index / grid[0].length);
    const col = index % grid[0].length;
    grid[row][col] = newState;
}

// Predicate to check if a cell should come alive
function comeAlive(index) {
    const row = Math.floor(index / grid[0].length);
    const col = index % grid[0].length;
    const livingNeighbors = countLivingNeighbors(grid, row, col);
    return livingNeighbors === 3 || (grid[row][col] && (livingNeighbors === 2 || livingNeighbors === 3));
}

// Predicate to check if a cell should go dead
function comeDead(index) {
    const row = Math.floor(index / grid[0].length);
    const col = index % grid[0].length;
    const livingNeighbors = countLivingNeighbors(grid, row, col);
    return livingNeighbors < 2 || livingNeighbors > 3;
}
```

### Example Usage

Here's how you would use these functions and predicates:

```javascript
// Assume grid is initialized and populated
changeState(5, true); // Change the state of the cell at index 5
if (comeAlive(5)) {
    console.log("Cell at index 5 should become alive or stay alive.");
}
if (comeDead(5)) {
    console.log("Cell at index 5 should go dead.");
}
```

This implementation assumes `grid` is globally accessible and properly initialized with boolean values indicating whether cells are alive or not. Adjustments may be necessary depending on the actual API and environment specifics.
