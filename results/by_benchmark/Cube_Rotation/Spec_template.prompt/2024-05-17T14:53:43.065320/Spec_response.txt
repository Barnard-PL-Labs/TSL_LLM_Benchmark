Here's the TSL specification based on the given description and functional requirements for controlling the cube's rotation with two buttons:

```TSL
always assume {
  // Assumption that left and right buttons are never pressed simultaneously
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Guarantee that pressing the left button causes the cube to rotate left until the right button is pressed
  pressL(e) -> ([cube <- rotateLeft(cube)] W pressR(e));

  // Guarantee that pressing the right button causes the cube to rotate right until the left button is pressed
  pressR(e) -> ([cube <- rotateRight(cube)] W pressL(e));
}
```

This specification clearly defines the interaction between the button presses and the resulting actions on the cube's rotation, ensuring the desired behavior that each button press initiates a rotation that lasts until the other button is pressed.
