Here's the TSL specification for the described control system for the cube:

```tsl
always assume {
    // Ensure that the left and right buttons are never pressed simultaneously
    !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
    // If the left button is pressed, begin rotating the cube to the left, 
    // continue until the right button is pressed
    pressL(e) -> [cube <- rotateLeft(cube)] W pressR(e);

    // If the right button is pressed, begin rotating the cube to the right,
    // continue until the left button is pressed
    pressR(e) -> [cube <- rotateRight(cube)] W pressL(e);
}
```

This TSL specification captures the exclusive interaction between the left and right buttons and the continuous control of the cube's rotation direction based on the button pressed.
