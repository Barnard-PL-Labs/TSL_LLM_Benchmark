Here is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description and the available functions and predicates for controlling a cube's rotation using left and right buttons:

```TSL
always assume {
  // Assume that the left and right buttons are never pressed simultaneously
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // If the left button is pressed, the cube should rotate to the left until the right button is pressed
  pressL(e) -> ([cube <- rotateLeft(cube)] W pressR(e));

  // If the right button is pressed, the cube should rotate to the right until the left button is pressed
  pressR(e) -> ([cube <- rotateRight(cube)] W pressL(e));
}
```

This TSL specification captures the desired behavior of the cube rotation system, where pressing one button initiates a consistent rotation in one direction, which can only be interrupted or reversed by pressing the opposing button. The mutual exclusion of button presses is also maintained to prevent conflicting commands.
