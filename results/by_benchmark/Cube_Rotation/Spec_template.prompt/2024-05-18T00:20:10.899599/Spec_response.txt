Here is the TSL specification for the described control system for a rotating cube with left and right button inputs:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure that the left and right buttons are never pressed at the same time
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Start rotating the cube to the left when the left button is pressed and continue until the right button is pressed
  pressL(e) -> ([cube <- rotateLeft(cube)] W pressR(e));

  // Start rotating the cube to the right when the right button is pressed and continue until the left button is pressed
  pressR(e) -> ([cube <- rotateRight(cube)] W pressL(e));
}
```

This TSL specification divides the logic into assumptions and guarantees. The assumption prevents simultaneous pressing of the left and right buttons. The guarantees define the behaviors of the cube's rotations depending on whether the left or right button is pressed, ensuring that each rotation direction is maintained until the opposite button is pressed.
