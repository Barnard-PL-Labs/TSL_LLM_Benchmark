Here is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description and the function and predicate details:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure that the left and right buttons are never pressed simultaneously
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // If the left button is pressed, start rotating the cube to the left until the right button is pressed
  pressL(e) -> ([cube <- rotateLeft(cube)] W pressR(e));

  // If the right button is pressed, start rotating the cube to the right until the left button is pressed
  pressR(e) -> ([cube <- rotateRight(cube)] W pressL(e));
}
```

This TSL specification ensures that:
- Both buttons cannot be pressed at the same time due to the assumption.
- Depending on which button is pressed, the cube either rotates left or right, and this continues until the opposite button is pressed, ensuring fluid and conflict-free control over the cube's rotation.
