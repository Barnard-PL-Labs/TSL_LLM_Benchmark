Here is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // The left and right buttons are never pressed at the same time
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // If the left button is pressed, start rotating the cube to the left and continue until the right button is pressed
  pressL(e) -> [cube <- rotateLeft(cube)] W pressR(e);

  // If the right button is pressed, start rotating the cube to the right and continue until the left button is pressed
  pressR(e) -> [cube <- rotateRight(cube)] W pressL(e);
}
```

This TSL specification captures the desired behavior of the cube's rotation being controlled by the left and right buttons, ensuring that pressing one button will initiate and maintain the respective rotation until the opposite button is pressed. The mutual exclusion of button presses is also maintained as per the assumptions.
