To implement the requirements detailed above using JavaScript and the provided API, we'll create functions and predicates that interact with a hypothetical 3D cube's rotation based on button presses. This will involve:

1. Creating functions to rotate the cube left or right by adjusting its `rotation.y` property.
2. Implementing predicates to detect left or right button presses using event listeners.

Here is how you can write these functions and predicates:

### Functions

These functions modify the `rotation.y` property of the cube to simulate rotation.

```javascript
function rotateLeft(cube) {
    // Assuming the cube's rotation in radians and decrement to rotate left
    cube.rotation.y -= Math.PI / 18;  // Rotate left by 10 degrees
}

function rotateRight(cube) {
    // Assuming the cube's rotation in radians and increment to rotate right
    cube.rotation.y += Math.PI / 18;  // Rotate right by 10 degrees
}
```

### Predicates

These predicates will utilize event listeners to return true when specific keys (left or right arrows) are pressed.

```javascript
// Variable to keep track of button states
const buttonState = {
    leftPressed: false,
    rightPressed: false
};

// Event listener to update button states
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(e) {
    if (e.key === 'ArrowLeft') {
        buttonState.leftPressed = true;
    } else if (e.key === 'ArrowRight') {
        buttonState.rightPressed = true;
    }
});

document.addEventListener('keyup', function(e) {
    if (e.key === 'ArrowLeft') {
        buttonState.leftPressed = false;
    } else if (e.key === 'ArrowRight') {
        buttonState.rightPressed = false;
    }
});

// Predicate to check if the left arrow key is pressed
function pressL() {
    return buttonState.leftPressed;
}

// Predicate to check if the right arrow key is pressed
function pressR() {
    return buttonState.rightPressed;
}
```

### Explanation

- **rotateLeft** and **rotateRight**: These functions adjust the `rotation.y` property of a cube object, which presumably affects its orientation in a 3D space. The rotation amount is specified in radians; here, a rotation of \( \frac{\pi}{18} \) radians is used, equivalent to 10 degrees.
  
- **pressL** and **pressR**: These predicates use a shared state object `buttonState` to track whether the left or right arrow keys are pressed. `keydown` and `keyup` event listeners update this state. The functions return the current state, allowing other parts of your program to react accordingly.

This setup ensures that when you integrate these functions and predicates with other parts of your application, you can effectively control and query the state of the cube based on user input.
