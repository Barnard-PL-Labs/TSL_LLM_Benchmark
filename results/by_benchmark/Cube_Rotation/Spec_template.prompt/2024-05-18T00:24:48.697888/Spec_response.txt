Here's how you would translate the provided natural language description into a TSL specification:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Assumption that left and right buttons are never pressed simultaneously
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Guarantee that pressing the left button causes the cube to rotate left until the right button is pressed
  pressL(e) -> [cube <- rotateLeft(cube)] W pressR(e);

  // Guarantee that pressing the right button causes the cube to rotate right until the left button is pressed
  pressR(e) -> [cube <- rotateRight(cube)] W pressL(e);
}
```

This specification clearly defines the behavior of a control system for a cube with two input buttons. The assumptions prevent simultaneous button presses, ensuring that the system's state is always valid. The guarantees describe the actions taken when each button is pressed, specifying the continuous rotation in the appropriate direction until the opposite button is pressed, thereby toggling the rotation direction accordingly.
