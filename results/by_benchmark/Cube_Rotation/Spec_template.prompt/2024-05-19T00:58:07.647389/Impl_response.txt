To implement the specified JavaScript functions and predicates using the provided system API, you can use the following code snippets. These will help in manipulating the cube's rotation based on button presses and in defining the required predicates.

### Functions to Rotate the Cube

These functions directly manipulate the `cube.rotation.y` property, which controls the y-axis rotation of the cube.

```javascript
/**
 * Rotates the cube to the left by decreasing the y rotation value.
 * @param {object} cube - The cube object with a rotation property.
 */
function rotateLeft(cube) {
    cube.rotation.y -= Math.PI / 18;  // Rotate by 10 degrees
}

/**
 * Rotates the cube to the right by increasing the y rotation value.
 * @param {object} cube - The cube object with a rotation property.
 */
function rotateRight(cube) {
    cube.rotation.y += Math.PI / 18;  // Rotate by 10 degrees
}
```

### Predicates for Button Presses

For the predicates, we will assume that there's a way to check the state of left and right button presses. Typically, this could be done using event listeners in a broader application scope, but here we simulate them with functions that need to be integrated with your event handling logic.

```javascript
/**
 * Predicate to check if the left button is pressed.
 * Assumes an event listener is set up elsewhere that updates this state.
 * @param {Event} e - The event object provided by the listener.
 * @returns {boolean} True if the left button is pressed, otherwise false.
 */
function pressL(e) {
    return e.key === "ArrowLeft" && e.type === "keydown";  // Example for keyboard left arrow
}

/**
 * Predicate to check if the right button is pressed.
 * Assumes an event listener is set up elsewhere that updates this state.
 * @param {Event} e - The event object provided by the listener.
 * @returns {boolean} True if the right button is pressed, otherwise false.
 */
function pressR(e) {
    return e.key === "ArrowRight" && e.type === "keydown";  // Example for keyboard right arrow
}
```

### Integrating with Event Listeners

To use these predicates effectively, you will need to set up event listeners in your application. Hereâ€™s an example of how you might set this up within a web environment:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
    if (pressL(event)) {
        rotateLeft(cube);  // Assuming 'cube' is accessible here
    }
    if (pressR(event)) {
        rotateRight(cube);  // Assuming 'cube' is accessible here
    }
});
```

### Notes

1. **Adjust Rotation Degrees**: The rotation angle in `rotateLeft` and `rotateRight` is set to 10 degrees (`Math.PI / 18`). You can adjust this value based on how much you want the cube to rotate per press.
2. **Event Handling**: The `pressL` and `pressR` predicates are designed to work within the context of an event listener, as shown in the integration example. Adjust the key detection as needed based on your input device or requirements.
3. **Cube Object**: Ensure that the `cube` object with the `rotation` property correctly references your 3D object in the environment where this code is implemented.
