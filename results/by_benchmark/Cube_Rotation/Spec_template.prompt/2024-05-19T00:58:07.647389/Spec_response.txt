Here is the TSL specification based on your description:

```
always assume {
  // Ensure the left and right buttons are not pressed simultaneously
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // If the left button is pressed, rotate the cube to the left until the right button is pressed
  pressL(e) -> [cube <- rotateLeft(cube)] W pressR(e);
  
  // If the right button is pressed, rotate the cube to the right until the left button is pressed
  pressR(e) -> [cube <- rotateRight(cube)] W pressL(e);
}
```

This TSL specification adheres to the natural language description by ensuring mutual exclusion on button presses and managing the cube's rotation based on the button inputs, maintaining the rotation direction until the opposite button is pressed.
