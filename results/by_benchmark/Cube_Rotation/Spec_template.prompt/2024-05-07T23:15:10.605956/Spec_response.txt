Here is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description and functions/predicates for controlling cube rotation with left and right buttons:

```TSL
always assume {
  // Ensure that the left and right buttons are never pressed simultaneously
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // When the left button is pressed, rotate the cube left until the right button is pressed
  pressL(e) -> [cube <- rotateLeft(cube)] W pressR(e);

  // When the right button is pressed, rotate the cube right until the left button is pressed
  pressR(e) -> [cube <- rotateRight(cube)] W pressL(e);
}
```

This TSL code captures the behavior of a control system where pressing one button initiates a rotation in one direction, which continues until the opposing button is pressed, as per the assumptions and guarantees specified.
