Here is the TSL specification based on your description for a control system managing a cube's rotation with two buttons:

```TSL
always assume {
  // It is assumed that the left and right buttons are never pressed at the same time
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // If the left button is pressed, the cube should rotate to the left until the right button is pressed
  pressL(e) -> ([cube <- rotateLeft(cube)] W pressR(e));

  // If the right button is pressed, the cube should rotate to the right until the left button is pressed
  pressR(e) -> ([cube <- rotateRight(cube)] W pressL(e));
}
```

This TSL code accurately reflects the assumptions and guarantees detailed in your description, ensuring the cube rotates according to the button pressed and that both buttons are not pressed simultaneously.
