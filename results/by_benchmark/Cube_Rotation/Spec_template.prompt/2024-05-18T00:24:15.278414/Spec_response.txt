Here is the TSL specification based on the provided description and functions:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensures that the left and right buttons are never pressed simultaneously.
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // If the left button is pressed, the cube should begin rotating to the left.
  // This rotation should continue until the right button is pressed.
  pressL(e) -> ([cube <- rotateLeft(cube)] W pressR(e));

  // Similarly, if the right button is pressed, the cube should rotate to the right.
  // This rotation should continue until the left button is pressed.
  pressR(e) -> ([cube <- rotateRight(cube)] W pressL(e));
}
```

This TSL code captures the assumptions about the mutual exclusivity of button presses and the guarantees concerning the cube's rotation in response to pressing the left or right buttons. The specification uses the weak until (`W`) operator to maintain the cube's rotation in one direction until the opposite button is pressed, ensuring that the rotation doesn't stop or switch until the specified condition is met.
