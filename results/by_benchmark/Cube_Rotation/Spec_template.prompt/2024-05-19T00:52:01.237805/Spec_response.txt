The TSL specification based on the provided natural language description and functions can be written as follows:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Assume that the left and right buttons are never pressed at the same time
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Guarantee that pressing the left button starts rotating the cube to the left until the right button is pressed
  pressL(e) -> ([cube <- rotateLeft(cube)] W pressR(e));

  // Guarantee that pressing the right button starts rotating the cube to the right until the left button is pressed
  pressR(e) -> ([cube <- rotateRight(cube)] W pressL(e));
}
```

This TSL specification sets up the system such that:
1. It is assumed that both buttons (left and right) cannot be pressed simultaneously, thus avoiding conflicts or undefined behavior.
2. The guarantees ensure that pressing one button initiates the rotation in one direction and maintains this rotation until the opposite button is pressed, thereby allowing smooth and controlled changes in the rotation direction of the cube.
