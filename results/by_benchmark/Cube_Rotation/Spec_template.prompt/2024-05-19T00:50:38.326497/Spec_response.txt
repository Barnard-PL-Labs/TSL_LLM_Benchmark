Based on the provided description, here is the TSL specification for the cube control system:

```tsl
always assume {
    // Assume that the left and right buttons are not pressed simultaneously
    !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
    // If the left button is pressed, the cube should rotate to the left until the right button is pressed
    pressL(e) -> ([cube <- rotateLeft(cube)] W pressR(e));

    // If the right button is pressed, the cube should rotate to the right until the left button is pressed
    pressR(e) -> ([cube <- rotateRight(cube)] W pressL(e));
}
```

This TSL specification ensures that:
1. The assumptions section indicates that pressing the left and right buttons simultaneously is impossible, avoiding conflicting commands.
2. The guarantees section outlines the behavior when either the left or right button is pressed, managing the rotation direction of the cube effectively. The rotation in a specified direction continues until the opposite button is pressed, ensuring smooth and uninterrupted control.
