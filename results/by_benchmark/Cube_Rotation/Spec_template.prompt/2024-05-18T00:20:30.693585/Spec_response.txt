Here is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description and the functions and predicates for controlling the rotation of a cube using left and right buttons:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Assumption that left and right buttons are never pressed simultaneously
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Guarantee that if the left button is pressed, the cube starts rotating to the left and continues until the right button is pressed
  pressL(e) -> [cube <- rotateLeft(cube)] W pressR(e);
  
  // Guarantee that if the right button is pressed, the cube starts rotating to the right and continues until the left button is pressed
  pressR(e) -> [cube <- rotateRight(cube)] W pressL(e);
}
```

This specification sets up the basic interaction rules for the cube's rotation controlled by the left and right buttons. It uses the weak until (`W`) operator to maintain the specified rotation until the opposite button is pressed, thereby ensuring a smooth and conflict-free control mechanism.
