Here's how you could write this scenario as a TSL specification:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Assumption that left and right buttons are never pressed at the same time
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Guarantee that pressing the left button initiates left rotation, which continues until the right button is pressed
  pressL(e) -> ([cube <- rotateLeft(cube)] W pressR(e));

  // Guarantee that pressing the right button initiates right rotation, which continues until the left button is pressed
  pressR(e) -> ([cube <- rotateRight(cube)] W pressL(e));
}
```

This TSL template satisfies the requirements laid out in the natural language description, by properly setting up assumptions and guarantees to handle the interactions with the cube's rotation based on button inputs.
