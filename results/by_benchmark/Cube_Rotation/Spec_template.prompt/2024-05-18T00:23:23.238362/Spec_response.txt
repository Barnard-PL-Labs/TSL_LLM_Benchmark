Here is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description and the functions and predicates:

```tsl
always assume {
    // Assume that left and right buttons cannot be pressed simultaneously
    !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
    // Guarantee the rotation of the cube to the left when the left button is pressed and continue until the right button is pressed
    pressL(e) -> [cube <- rotateLeft(cube)] W pressR(e);
    
    // Guarantee the rotation of the cube to the right when the right button is pressed and continue until the left button is pressed
    pressR(e) -> [cube <- rotateRight(cube)] W pressL(e);
}
```

This specification adheres to the conditions that:
1. The left and right buttons cannot be pressed at the same time.
2. The direction of the cubeâ€™s rotation is controlled by either the left or the right button presses, and the rotation continues in one direction until the opposite button is pressed, ensuring smooth and conflict-free control of the cube's rotation.
