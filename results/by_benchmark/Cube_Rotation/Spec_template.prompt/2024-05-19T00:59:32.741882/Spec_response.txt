Here is the TSL specification based on the requirements provided in the natural language description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Assumption that the left and right buttons are never pressed simultaneously
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Guarantee that pressing the left button causes the cube to rotate left until the right button is pressed
  pressL(e) -> ([cube <- rotateLeft(cube)] W pressR(e));

  // Guarantee that pressing the right button causes the cube to rotate right until the left button is pressed
  pressR(e) -> ([cube <- rotateRight(cube)] W pressL(e));
}
```

Explanation:

- **Assumptions**:
  - `!(pressL(e) && pressR(e))`: Ensures mutual exclusion between the left and right button presses, meaning they cannot be pressed at the same time.

- **Guarantees**:
  - `pressL(e) -> ([cube <- rotateLeft(cube)] W pressR(e))`: Specifies that if the left button is pressed, the cube should rotate left continuously until the right button is pressed.
  - `pressR(e) -> ([cube <- rotateRight(cube)] W pressL(e))`: Specifies that if the right button is pressed, the cube should rotate right continuously until the left button is pressed.

This specification ensures that the cube's rotation can be directly controlled by the user through the left and right buttons, with each button press initiating a rotation direction that continues until the opposite button is pressed.
