Here is the TSL specification based on the provided description of the cube control system using two buttons for rotating the cube left or right:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Assume that the left and right buttons are never pressed at the same time
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // If the left button is pressed, rotate the cube to the left until the right button is pressed
  pressL(e) -> [cube <- rotateLeft(cube)] W pressR(e);

  // If the right button is pressed, rotate the cube to the right until the left button is pressed
  pressR(e) -> [cube <- rotateRight(cube)] W pressL(e);
}
```

This specification meets the criteria outlined:
- It assumes that both buttons cannot be pressed simultaneously.
- It guarantees that pressing the left button causes the cube to rotate left until the right button is pressed and vice versa, ensuring smooth control of the cube's rotation direction.
