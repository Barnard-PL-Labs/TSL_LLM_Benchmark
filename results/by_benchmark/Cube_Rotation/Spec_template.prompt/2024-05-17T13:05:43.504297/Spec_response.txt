Here is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description and functions:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Assume that the left and right buttons are never pressed simultaneously
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // If the left button is pressed, rotate the cube to the left. This rotation should continue until the right button is pressed.
  pressL(e) -> ([cube <- rotateLeft(cube)] W pressR(e));

  // If the right button is pressed, rotate the cube to the right. This rotation should continue until the left button is pressed.
  pressR(e) -> ([cube <- rotateRight(cube)] W pressL(e));
}
```

In this specification:

- **Assumptions** section ensures that it's not possible for both the left and right buttons to be pressed at the same time.
- **Guarantees** section defines how the cube should react when either the left or right button is pressed. The cube continues rotating in the desired direction until the opposite button is pressed, ensuring a smooth control over the cube's rotation as per the user's input.
