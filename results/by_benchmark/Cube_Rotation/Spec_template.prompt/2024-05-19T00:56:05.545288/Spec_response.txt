Here is a TSL specification based on the provided description and functional requirements:

```
always assume {
    // Ensure that the left and right buttons are not pressed simultaneously
    !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
    // When the left button is pressed, rotate the cube to the left until the right button is pressed
    pressL(e) -> [cube <- rotateLeft(cube)] W pressR(e);

    // When the right button is pressed, rotate the cube to the right until the left button is pressed
    pressR(e) -> [cube <- rotateRight(cube)] W pressL(e);
}
```

This specification defines the behavior of a control system for a cube, ensuring that pressing the left or right buttons initiates and maintains the appropriate rotation direction, and that such actions are mutually exclusive, preventing simultaneous conflicting commands.
