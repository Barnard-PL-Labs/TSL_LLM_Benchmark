Here is the TSL specification based on the natural language description provided:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Assumption that left and right buttons are never pressed at the same time
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Guarantee that pressing the left button initiates and maintains left rotation until the right button is pressed
  pressL(e) -> ([cube <- rotateLeft(cube)] W pressR(e));

  // Guarantee that pressing the right button initiates and maintains right rotation until the left button is pressed
  pressR(e) -> ([cube <- rotateRight(cube)] W pressL(e));
}
```

This specification dictates the following:
- It is assumed that both the left and right buttons cannot be pressed simultaneously.
- When the left button is pressed, the cube starts to rotate to the left and continues to do so until the right button is pressed.
- Conversely, when the right button is pressed, the cube starts to rotate to the right and continues to do so until the left button is pressed.
