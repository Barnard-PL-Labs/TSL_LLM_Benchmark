To implement the described control system for the cube using JavaScript, we need to define a function `updateState` that processes the input from the buttons and updates the cube's rotation accordingly. Below is a possible implementation of this function:

```javascript
function updateState({currentState, pressL, pressR, cube}) {
    // Ensure mutual exclusion of button presses (Assumption 1)
    if (pressL && pressR) {
        throw new Error("Both buttons cannot be pressed at the same time.");
    }

    // If the left button is pressed (Guarantee 2)
    if (pressL) {
        // Rotate the cube to the left until the right button is pressed
        if (currentState.lastButtonPressed !== 'L') {
            currentState.lastButtonPressed = 'L';
            cube = rotateLeft(cube);
        }
    }
    // If the right button is pressed (Guarantee 3)
    else if (pressR) {
        // Rotate the cube to the right until the left button is pressed
        if (currentState.lastButtonPressed !== 'R') {
            currentState.lastButtonPressed = 'R';
            cube = rotateRight(cube);
        }
    }
    // Maintain the current rotation if no new button is pressed
    else {
        if (currentState.lastButtonPressed === 'L') {
            cube = rotateLeft(cube);
        } else if (currentState.lastButtonPressed === 'R') {
            cube = rotateRight(cube);
        }
    }

    return { currentState, cube };
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Input Parameters**: The function accepts an object with properties including:
   - `currentState`: An object to keep track of the last button pressed.
   - `pressL`: A boolean indicating if the left button is pressed.
   - `pressR`: A boolean indicating if the right button is pressed.
   - `cube`: The current state of the cube.

2. **Mutual Exclusion**: The function starts by checking if both buttons are pressed simultaneously, which is not allowed (throwing an error if this happens).

3. **Button Press Logic**:
   - If the left button (`pressL`) is pressed, the function checks if it was not already rotating to the left (`lastButtonPressed !== 'L'`). If not, it updates the last button pressed to 'L' and rotates the cube to the left.
   - If the right button (`pressR`) is pressed, it similarly checks and updates for right rotation.
   - If neither button is newly pressed, the cube continues rotating in the last direction set (`lastButtonPressed`).

4. **Output**: The function returns an updated object containing `currentState` and the modified `cube` state.

This setup ensures that the cube's rotation direction can be smoothly and accurately controlled by pressing the left or right button, adhering to the specified guarantees and assumptions.
