Here's the TSL specification based on the provided description and the functions/predicates for the cube's control system:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Define the mutual exclusivity between pressing the left button and the right button
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // When the left button is pressed, rotate the cube to the left until the right button is pressed
  pressL(e) -> ([cube <- rotateLeft(cube)] W pressR(e));
  
  // When the right button is pressed, rotate the cube to the right until the left button is pressed
  pressR(e) -> ([cube <- rotateRight(cube)] W pressL(e));
}
```

This TSL specification ensures that:
1. The left and right buttons cannot be pressed at the same time.
2. Pressing the left button will rotate the cube to the left until the right button is pressed, and vice versa.
3. The cube's rotation direction changes only when the opposite button is pressed.
