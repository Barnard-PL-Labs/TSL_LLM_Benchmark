The given description outlines a control system where two buttons influence a cubeâ€™s rotation. The system guards against simultaneous button presses and changes the cube's rotation direction based on the button pressed. Here's how this can be translated into a TSL specification:

```TSL
always assume {
  // Define the exclusive relationship between pressing the right button and the left button
  !(pressR(e) && pressL(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // When right button is pressed, rotate the cube to the right until the left button is pressed
  pressR(e) -> ([cube <- rotateRight(cube)] W pressL(e));

  // When left button is pressed, rotate the cube to the left until the right button is pressed
  pressL(e) -> ([cube <- rotateLeft(cube)] W pressR(e));
}
```

### Explanation:

**Assumptions**:
- The system assumes that both buttons (`pressL` for left and `pressR` for right) cannot be pressed at the same time (`!(pressR(e) && pressL(e))`). This prevents any conflicting commands or undefined states for cube rotation.

**Guarantees**:
- When the right button is pressed (`pressR(e)`), the cube is set to rotate to the right (`rotateRight(cube)`). This rotation is maintained until the left button is pressed (`W pressL(e)`), indicating a switch in the direction of rotation.
- Conversely, when the left button is pressed (`pressL(e)`), the cube rotates to the left (`rotateLeft(cube)`). This continues until the right button is pressed (`W pressR(e)`), signaling a change to rotate to the right.

This TSL specification effectively handles the control of the cube's rotation based on user input while ensuring that button presses are mutually exclusive to prevent simultaneous conflicting commands.
