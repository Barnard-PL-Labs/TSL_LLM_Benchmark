A system environment has the following API. Using the API, implement the following methods in JavaScript. The methods are divided into two categories, "functions" and "predicates". "functions" can be arbitrary functions, but "predicates" always return a boolean.

Functions and predicates to implement:


Cells:
  "cube" is a cell that represents the state of the signal that determines how the cube should move

Functions:
- rotateLeft(cube): Rotate the cube to the left.
- rotateRight(cube): Rotate the cube to the right.

Predicates:
- pressL(e): A predicate that returns true when the left button is pressed. Event listener should be inside the function.
- pressR(e): A predicate that returns true when the right button is pressed. Event listener should be inside the function.

System API:


/*

Get or set the y position of the cube in 3D by changing "cube.rotation.y".

*/
