Here is the TSL specification for the described control system for a cube with left and right buttons influencing its rotation:

```tsl
always assume {
    // Ensure that both buttons are not pressed at the same time
    !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
    // When the left button is pressed, rotate the cube to the left until the right button is pressed
    pressL(e) -> ([cube <- rotateLeft(cube)] W pressR(e));
    
    // When the right button is pressed, rotate the cube to the right until the left button is pressed
    pressR(e) -> ([cube <- rotateRight(cube)] W pressL(e));
}
```

This specification sets up the assumptions and guarantees for the cube's rotation control system:
- It assumes that both left and right buttons cannot be pressed simultaneously.
- It guarantees that pressing the left button will initiate a continuous rotation to the left until the right button is pressed, and vice versa for the right button.
