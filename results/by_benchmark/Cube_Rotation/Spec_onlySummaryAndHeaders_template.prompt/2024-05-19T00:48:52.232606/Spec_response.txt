Here's the TSL specification based on the natural language description provided:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure that both left and right buttons are not pressed simultaneously
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // When the left button is pressed, rotate the cube to the left until the right button is pressed
  pressL(e) -> [cube <- rotateLeft(cube)] W pressR(e);

  // When the right button is pressed, rotate the cube to the right until the left button is pressed
  pressR(e) -> [cube <- rotateRight(cube)] W pressL(e);
}
```

This TSL code enforces the mutual exclusivity of the left and right button presses and specifies the behavior of the system in handling the cube's rotation based on the button pressed, adhering to the described control logic.
