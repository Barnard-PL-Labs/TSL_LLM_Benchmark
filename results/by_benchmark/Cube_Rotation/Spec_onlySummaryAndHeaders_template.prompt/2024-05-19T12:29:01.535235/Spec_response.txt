Here's the TSL specification based on the given functions, predicates, and the description of the control system for the cube:

```tsl
always assume {
    // Define the exclusive relationship between pressing the right button and the left button
    !(pressR(e) && pressL(e));
}

always guarantee {
    // When the right button is pressed, rotate the cube to the right and continue doing so until the left button is pressed
    pressR(e) -> ([cube <- rotateRight(cube)] W pressL(e));
    
    // When the left button is pressed, rotate the cube to the left and continue doing so until the right button is pressed
    pressL(e) -> ([cube <- rotateLeft(cube)] W pressR(e));
}
```

This specification controls the cube's rotation by ensuring that pressing one button will initiate rotation in one direction and maintain that direction until the opposite button is pressed. It also enforces mutual exclusivity between the two button presses to avoid conflicts in the control logic.
