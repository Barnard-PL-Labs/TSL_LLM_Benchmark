Here's a TSL specification for the described cube control system:

```
always assume {
  // Ensure that both buttons are not pressed simultaneously
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // When the left button is pressed, rotate the cube to the left, continue until the right button is pressed
  pressL(e) -> ([cube <- rotateLeft(cube)] W pressR(e));

  // When the right button is pressed, rotate the cube to the right, continue until the left button is pressed
  pressR(e) -> ([cube <- rotateRight(cube)] W pressL(e));
}
``` 

This specification captures the requirement that the cube should rotate in a specific direction based on whether the left or right button is pressed and should continue doing so until the opposite button is pressed, without both buttons being pressed at the same time.
