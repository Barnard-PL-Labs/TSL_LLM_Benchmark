Below is the TSL specification based on the provided description and functions:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure that both buttons are not pressed at the same time
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // When the left button is pressed, rotate the cube to the left until the right button is pressed
  pressL(e) -> ([cube <- rotateLeft(cube)] W pressR(e));

  // When the right button is pressed, rotate the cube to the right until the left button is pressed
  pressR(e) -> ([cube <- rotateRight(cube)] W pressL(e));
}
```

This TSL specification incorporates the rules for mutual exclusion between the left and right button presses and assigns appropriate rotation actions to the cube based on which button is pressed. The rotation actions persist until the opposite button is pressed, as described in the natural language specification.
