To implement the given requirements using JavaScript, we will need to define the functions `rotateLeft` and `rotateRight` to manipulate the cube's rotation, along with predicates `pressL` and `pressR` that detect button presses. Here's how you can do it:

### Functions to Rotate the Cube

```javascript
function rotateLeft(cube) {
    // Assuming cube.rotation.y is a numeric value representing the rotation in degrees or radians
    // This function will increase the rotation to the left
    cube.rotation.y -= 5; // rotate left by 5 units; adjust as necessary
}

function rotateRight(cube) {
    // This function will increase the rotation to the right
    cube.rotation.y += 5; // rotate right by 5 units; adjust as necessary
}
```

### Predicates to Detect Button Presses

For the predicates, you'll want to setup event listeners that can update a state based on button presses. Assuming that `e` represents an event object, you might typically check if a specific key is pressed for keyboard events. Let's say the left arrow key (`ArrowLeft`) corresponds to rotating left and the right arrow key (`ArrowRight`) to rotating right.

```javascript
// Initialize state variables to track button presses
let leftPressed = false;
let rightPressed = false;

// Setup event listeners
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(e) {
    if (e.key === 'ArrowLeft') {
        leftPressed = true;
    } else if (e.key === 'ArrowRight') {
        rightPressed = true;
    }
});

document.addEventListener('keyup', function(e) {
    if (e.key === 'ArrowLeft') {
        leftPressed = false;
    } else if (e.key === 'ArrowRight') {
        rightPressed = false;
    }
});

// Predicate functions
function pressL(e) {
    return leftPressed; // returns true if the left arrow key is currently pressed
}

function pressR(e) {
    return rightPressed; // returns true if the right arrow key is currently pressed
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **rotateLeft** and **rotateRight** Functions:
   - These functions modify `cube.rotation.y` to change the cube's orientation in the Y-axis.
   - Adjust the rotation value (`5` in this example) based on how sensitive the rotation should be.

2. **pressL** and **pressR** Predicates:
   - Use the `keydown` and `keyup` events to track when specific keys are pressed and released.
   - Update the `leftPressed` and `rightPressed` boolean flags accordingly.
   - The predicate functions return the current state of these flags, indicating whether the respective keys are pressed.

This setup assumes that `cube` is an object accessible within the scope of these functions and has a `rotation` property with a `y` sub-property that can be modified to affect the cube's rotation. Adjustments might be needed depending on the actual implementation details of your cube object and the environment it's used in.
