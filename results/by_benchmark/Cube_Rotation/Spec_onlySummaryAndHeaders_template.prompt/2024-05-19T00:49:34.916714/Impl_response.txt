Here is how you can implement the required functions and predicates in JavaScript, considering the constraints of the system environment:

### 1. Setting up the JavaScript environment:
Before we start writing our methods, we need to assume there is an HTML structure and a corresponding event system where user interactions can trigger events. 

### 2. Implementing Functions:
For the `rotateLeft` and `rotateRight` functions, we'll modify `cube.rotation.y`. Assuming that `cube.rotation.y` can be incremented or decremented to rotate the cube, we can define our functions as follows:

```javascript
/**
 * Rotate the cube to the left by decrementing the y rotation angle.
 * @param {object} cube - The cube object with a rotation property.
 */
function rotateLeft(cube) {
    cube.rotation.y -= Math.PI / 2; // Rotate 90 degrees to the left
}

/**
 * Rotate the cube to the right by incrementing the y rotation angle.
 * @param {object} cube - The cube object with a rotation property.
 */
function rotateRight(cube) {
    cube.rotation.y += Math.PI / 2; // Rotate 90 degrees to the right
}
```

### 3. Implementing Predicates:
The predicates `pressL` and `pressR` require event listener implementations to determine if a specific key (presumably for left and right movement) has been pressed. Here's how this could be implemented using JavaScript event listeners:

```javascript
/**
 * Predicate to check if the left button is pressed.
 * This function sets up an event listener and checks for a specific key press.
 * @returns {boolean} - Returns true if the left key (e.g., ArrowLeft) is pressed.
 */
function pressL() {
    let isLeftPressed = false;
    document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
        if (event.key === 'ArrowLeft') {
            isLeftPressed = true;
        }
    });
    document.addEventListener('keyup', function(event) {
        if (event.key === 'ArrowLeft') {
            isLeftPressed = false;
        }
    });
    return () => isLeftPressed;
}

/**
 * Predicate to check if the right button is pressed.
 * This function sets up an event listener and checks for a specific key press.
 * @returns {boolean} - Returns true if the right key (e.g., ArrowRight) is pressed.
 */
function pressR() {
    let isRightPressed = false;
    document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
        if (event.key === 'ArrowRight') {
            isRightPressed = true;
        }
    });
    document.addEventListener('keyup', function(event) {
        if (event.key === 'ArrowRight') {
            isRightPressed = false;
        }
    });
    return () => isRightPressed;
}
```

### Notes:
1. The `rotateLeft` and `rotateRight` functions assume you can directly manipulate `cube.rotation.y` as per the system's API. Adjust the increment/decrement values (here, `Math.PI / 2`) based on how much you need to rotate per invocation.

2. The predicates `pressL` and `pressR` implement basic key event listeners. They check if the left or right arrow keys are pressed, respectively. The functions return a closure that captures whether the key is currently pressed, making it a callable predicate that returns a boolean.

3. Ensure that your web environment supports the necessary JavaScript functionalities and that the 'cube' object conforms to the expected structure and behavior as outlined in the API.
