```TSL
always assume {
  // Ensure that both buttons are not pressed simultaneously
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // When the left button is pressed, rotate the cube left until the right button is pressed
  pressL(e) -> ([cube <- rotateLeft(cube)] W pressR(e));
  
  // When the right button is pressed, rotate the cube right until the left button is pressed
  pressR(e) -> ([cube <- rotateRight(cube)] W pressL(e));
}
```

This TSL specification describes a control system for a cube where pressing the left or right button starts a continuous rotation to the left or right, respectively. The rotation direction is maintained until the opposite button is pressed, abiding by the constraint that both buttons cannot be pressed simultaneously.
