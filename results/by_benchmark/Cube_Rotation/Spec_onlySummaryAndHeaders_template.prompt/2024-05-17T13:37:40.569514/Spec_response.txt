Here is the TSL specification based on your natural language description of a control system for a cube with left and right buttons influencing rotation:

```TSL
always assume {
    // Ensure that both buttons are not pressed simultaneously
    !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
    // When the left button is pressed, rotate the cube to the left until the right button is pressed
    pressL(e) -> [cube <- rotateLeft(cube)] W pressR(e);
    
    // When the right button is pressed, rotate the cube to the right until the left button is pressed
    pressR(e) -> [cube <- rotateRight(cube)] W pressL(e);
}
``` 

This TSL code captures the behavior where pressing one button starts the rotation in one direction and continues until the opposite button is pressed, ensuring no simultaneous button presses.
