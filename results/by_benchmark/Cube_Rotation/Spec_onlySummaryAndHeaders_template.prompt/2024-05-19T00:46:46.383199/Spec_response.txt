Here's the TSL specification for the described system that manages the rotation of a cube based on input from two buttons (left and right), ensuring that both buttons are not pressed simultaneously and managing the rotation direction continuously until the opposite button is pressed:

```tsl
always assume {
    // Ensure that both the left and right buttons are never pressed simultaneously
    !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
    // When the left button is pressed, rotate the cube to the left until the right button is pressed
    pressL(e) -> ([cube <- rotateLeft(cube)] W pressR(e));

    // When the right button is pressed, rotate the cube to the right until the left button is pressed
    pressR(e) -> ([cube <- rotateRight(cube)] W pressL(e));
}
```

This specification sets up a control system where the cube's rotation direction is managed based on button presses. It uses the `W` (weak until) operator to maintain the rotation direction until the opposite button is pressed.
