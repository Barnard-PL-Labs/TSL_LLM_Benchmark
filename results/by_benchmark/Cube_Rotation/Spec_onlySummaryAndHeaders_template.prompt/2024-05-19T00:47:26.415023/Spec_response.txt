Here is the TSL (Temporal Stream Logic) specification based on the provided description and functions:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure that the left and right buttons are not pressed at the same time
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // When the left button is pressed, rotate the cube to the left until the right button is pressed
  pressL(e) -> ([cube <- rotateLeft(cube)] W pressR(e));
  
  // When the right button is pressed, rotate the cube to the right until the left button is pressed
  pressR(e) -> ([cube <- rotateRight(cube)] W pressL(e));
}
```

This specification defines:
1. An assumption (`always assume`) that prevents the left and right buttons from being pressed simultaneously.
2. A guarantee (`always guarantee`) that defines the behavior of the cube's rotation:
   - If the left button is pressed, the cube will continue to rotate left until the right button is pressed.
   - If the right button is pressed, the cube will continue to rotate right until the left button is pressed.
