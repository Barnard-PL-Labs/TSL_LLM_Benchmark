Here is the TSL specification based on the provided description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Define the mutual exclusion between pressing the right button and the left button
  !(pressR(e) && pressL(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // When the right button is pressed, rotate the cube to the right until the left button is pressed
  pressR(e) -> [cube <- rotateRight(cube)] W pressL(e);

  // When the left button is pressed, rotate the cube to the left until the right button is pressed
  pressL(e) -> [cube <- rotateLeft(cube)] W pressR(e);
}
```

This specification captures the requirement that the left and right buttons cannot be pressed at the same time and defines how the cube's rotation should be controlled based on the button presses, continuing the respective rotation direction until the opposite button is pressed.
