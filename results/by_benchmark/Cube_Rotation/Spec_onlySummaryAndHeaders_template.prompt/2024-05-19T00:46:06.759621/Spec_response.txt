Here is a TSL specification based on the given natural language description and the provided cells, functions, and predicates:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure that the left and right buttons are not pressed simultaneously
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // When the left button is pressed, rotate the cube to the left until the right button is pressed
  pressL(e) -> ([cube <- rotateLeft(cube)] W pressR(e));

  // When the right button is pressed, rotate the cube to the right until the left button is pressed
  pressR(e) -> ([cube <- rotateRight(cube)] W pressL(e));
}
```

This specification ensures that the cube responds to button presses by rotating appropriately and that the rotation continues in the specified direction until the opposite button is pressed. It also upholds the requirement that both buttons are not pressed simultaneously, avoiding conflicting commands.
