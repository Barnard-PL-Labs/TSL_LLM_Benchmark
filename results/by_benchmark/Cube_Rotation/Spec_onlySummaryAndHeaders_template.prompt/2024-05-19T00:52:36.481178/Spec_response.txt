Here's the TSL specification for the described system controlling the cube's rotation based on left and right button inputs:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure that both left and right buttons cannot be pressed simultaneously
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // When the left button is pressed, rotate the cube to the left until the right button is pressed
  pressL(e) -> [cube <- rotateLeft(cube)] W pressR(e);
  
  // When the right button is pressed, rotate the cube to the right until the left button is pressed
  pressR(e) -> [cube <- rotateRight(cube)] W pressL(e);
}
```

This TSL specification ensures that the cube responds to button presses by rotating in the specified direction and prevents simultaneous conflicting commands by ensuring that both buttons cannot be pressed at the same time. The rotation direction is maintained until the opposite button is pressed, as per the requirements.
