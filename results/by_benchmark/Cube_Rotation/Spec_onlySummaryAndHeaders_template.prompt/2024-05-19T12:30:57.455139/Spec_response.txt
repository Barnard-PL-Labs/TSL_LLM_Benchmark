Based on the description provided, here is the TSL specification for the control system managing a cube's rotation with left and right buttons:

```
always assume {
   // Ensures that both buttons are not pressed at the same time
   !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
   // When the left button is pressed, rotate the cube to the left until the right button is pressed
   pressL(e) -> ([cube <- rotateLeft(cube)] W pressR(e));

   // When the right button is pressed, rotate the cube to the right until the left button is pressed
   pressR(e) -> ([cube <- rotateRight(cube)] W pressL(e));
}
```

This TSL code defines that the cube must rotate in one direction based on the button pressed and continue doing so until the opposite button is pressed, with a safety condition ensuring that both buttons cannot be pressed simultaneously.
