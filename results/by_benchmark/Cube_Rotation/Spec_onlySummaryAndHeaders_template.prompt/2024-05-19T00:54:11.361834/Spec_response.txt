Based on the given natural language description and the available functions and predicates, here is a translated TSL specification for the control system of a cube with two buttons affecting its rotation:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure that both left and right buttons cannot be pressed simultaneously
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // When the left button is pressed, rotate the cube to the left until the right button is pressed
  pressL(e) -> ([cube <- rotateLeft(cube)] W pressR(e));
  
  // When the right button is pressed, rotate the cube to the right until the left button is pressed
  pressR(e) -> ([cube <- rotateRight(cube)] W pressL(e));
}
```

This TSL specification includes the assumptions to avoid concurrent button presses and the guarantees to manage the cube's rotation based on the button pressed, where the rotation direction is maintained until the opposite button is pressed.
