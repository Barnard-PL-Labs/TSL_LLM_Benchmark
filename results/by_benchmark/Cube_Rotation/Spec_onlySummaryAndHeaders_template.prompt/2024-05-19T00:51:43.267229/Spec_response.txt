Here's the TSL specification for the control system of a cube influenced by left and right button presses, ensuring mutual exclusion of button presses and handling rotation direction:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure that both buttons are not pressed simultaneously
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // When the left button is pressed, rotate the cube to the left until the right button is pressed
  pressL(e) -> ([cube <- rotateLeft(cube)] W pressR(e));

  // When the right button is pressed, rotate the cube to the right until the left button is pressed
  pressR(e) -> ([cube <- rotateRight(cube)] W pressL(e));
}
```

This TSL code defines two main conditions:
1. Mutual exclusion of button presses is ensured by the assumption block, which prevents both `pressL(e)` and `pressR(e)` from being true at the same time.
2. The guarantee block manages the cube's rotation direction based on the button pressed. When the left button is pressed, the cube is set to rotate left and this continues until the right button is pressed. Conversely, when the right button is pressed, the cube is set to rotate right until the left button is pressed.
