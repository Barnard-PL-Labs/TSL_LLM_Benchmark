Here is the TSL specification for the described control system:

```TSL
always assume {
    // Ensure that both buttons are not pressed at the same time
    !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
    // When the left button is pressed, rotate the cube to the left until the right button is pressed
    pressL(e) -> [cube <- rotateLeft(cube)] W pressR(e);

    // When the right button is pressed, rotate the cube to the right until the left button is pressed
    pressR(e) -> [cube <- rotateRight(cube)] W pressL(e);
}
``` 

This specification includes the assumptions and guarantees to manage the cube's behavior based on the button inputs. It ensures mutual exclusion of the button presses and defines the rotation actions accordingly.
