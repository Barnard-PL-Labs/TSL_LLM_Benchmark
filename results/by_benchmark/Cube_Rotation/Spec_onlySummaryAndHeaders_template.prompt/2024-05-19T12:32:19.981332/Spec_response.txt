Here is the TSL specification for the control system described for the cube, using the provided functions and predicates:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Assume that both buttons cannot be pressed at the same time
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Guarantee that pressing the left button will cause the cube to rotate left until the right button is pressed
  pressL(e) -> ([cube <- rotateLeft(cube)] W pressR(e));
  
  // Guarantee that pressing the right button will cause the cube to rotate right until the left button is pressed
  pressR(e) -> ([cube <- rotateRight(cube)] W pressL(e));
}
```

This TSL specification ensures that:
1. The `pressL(e)` and `pressR(e)` predicates capture the events of pressing the left and right buttons respectively.
2. The `rotateLeft(cube)` function is called to rotate the cube to the left when the left button is pressed, and this continues until the right button is pressed.
3. Similarly, the `rotateRight(cube)` function is called to rotate the cube to the right when the right button is pressed, and this continues until the left button is pressed.
4. The system maintains mutual exclusivity between the left and right button presses to prevent simultaneous activation.
