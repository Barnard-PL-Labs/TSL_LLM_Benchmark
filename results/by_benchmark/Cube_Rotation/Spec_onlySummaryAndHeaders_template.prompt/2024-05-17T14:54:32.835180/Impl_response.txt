To implement the described functions and predicates in JavaScript using the provided system API for cube manipulation, you will need to set up event listeners for button presses and functions to alter the cube's rotation. Here’s how you can structure your code:

### Functions Implementation
```javascript
function rotateLeft(cube) {
  // Assuming that a decrease in the y rotation represents a rotation to the left
  cube.rotation.y -= Math.PI / 4; // Rotate the cube left by 45 degrees
}

function rotateRight(cube) {
  // Assuming that an increase in the y rotation represents a rotation to the right
  cube.rotation.y += Math.PI / 4; // Rotate the cube right by 45 degrees
}
```

### Predicates Implementation
For the predicates, you'll set up event listeners that update a state when the left or right button is pressed. You can use simple flags to store the press state of each button.

```javascript
let leftPressed = false;
let rightPressed = false;

// Assuming `document` is available and buttons have event listeners attached
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(e) {
  if (e.key === 'ArrowLeft') { // Adjust the key as necessary
    leftPressed = true;
  }
  if (e.key === 'ArrowRight') { // Adjust the key as necessary
    rightPressed = true;
  }
});

document.addEventListener('keyup', function(e) {
  if (e.key === 'ArrowLeft') {
    leftPressed = false;
  }
  if (e.key === 'ArrowRight') {
    rightPressed = false;
  }
});

function pressL(e) {
  return leftPressed;
}

function pressR(e) {
  return rightPressed;
}
```

### Notes
1. **Rotation Values**: The rotation step (e.g., `Math.PI / 4`) can be adjusted based on how much you want the cube to rotate per action. The example uses 45 degrees (π/4 radians).
   
2. **Key Codes**: The key codes (`'ArrowLeft'` and `'ArrowRight'`) are used to detect left and right arrow key presses. Modify these if you have different keys for left and right actions.

3. **Event Listener Setup**: It’s important to use both `keydown` and `keyup` events to accurately track when keys are pressed and released.

4. **Global Flags**: The `leftPressed` and `rightPressed` flags are used to maintain the current state of the key presses. This allows the predicates `pressL` and `pressR` to simply return the current state, reflecting real-time user input.

This setup should allow you to integrate the cube manipulation functions and button press predicates within a system that utilizes an API to manage 3D cube rotation based on keyboard inputs.
