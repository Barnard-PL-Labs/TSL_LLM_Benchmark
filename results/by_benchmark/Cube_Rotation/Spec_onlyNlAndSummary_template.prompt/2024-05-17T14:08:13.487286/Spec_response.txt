Here is a TSL specification for the described control system for a cube with left and right button inputs influencing the cube's rotation:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Assumption that the left and right buttons are never pressed at the same time
  !(pressL && pressR);
}

always guarantee {
  // Guarantee that if the left button is pressed, the cube should rotate left until the right button is pressed
  pressL -> [cube.rotation <- "left"] W pressR;

  // Guarantee that if the right button is pressed, the cube should rotate right until the left button is pressed
  pressR -> [cube.rotation <- "right"] W pressL;
}
```

This TSL specification ensures that the cube's rotation direction is controlled by the individual press of either the left or right button and maintains the specified rotation until the opposite button is pressed, adhering to the assumptions and guarantees provided.
