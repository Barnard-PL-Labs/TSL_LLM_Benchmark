Here is the TSL specification that matches the given natural language description for the cube control system:

``` 
always assume {
  // Ensure that the left and right buttons are never pressed at the same time
  !(pressLeft && pressRight);
}

always guarantee {
  // If the left button is pressed, begin rotating the cube to the left and continue until the right button is pressed
  pressLeft -> ([cube.rotation <- "left"] W pressRight);

  // If the right button is pressed, begin rotating the cube to the right and continue until the left button is pressed
  pressRight -> ([cube.rotation <- "right"] W pressLeft);
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Assumptions:** The system assumes mutual exclusion between the left and right button presses, ensuring that both are not pressed simultaneously, which could lead to conflicting commands or undefined behavior.
- **Guarantees:** 
  - When the left button is pressed, the cube's rotation direction is set to "left", and it keeps rotating in this direction until the right button is pressed.
  - Similarly, when the right button is pressed, the rotation direction is set to "right", continuing until the left button is pressed.
  - This control mechanism allows for smooth and conflict-free manipulation of the cube's rotation, directly dictated by the userâ€™s button inputs.
