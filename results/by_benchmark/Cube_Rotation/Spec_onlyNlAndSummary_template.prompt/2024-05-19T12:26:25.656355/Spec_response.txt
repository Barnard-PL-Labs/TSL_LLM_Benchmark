Below is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description for a cube control system with left and right button inputs that influence the cube's rotation:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Assumption that left and right buttons are not pressed at the same time
  !(pressL && pressR);
}

always guarantee {
  // If the left button is pressed, set the cube's rotation to the left continuously until the right button is pressed
  pressL -> ([cube.rotation <- "left"] W pressR);

  // If the right button is pressed, set the cube's rotation to the right continuously until the left button is pressed
  pressR -> ([cube.rotation <- "right"] W pressL);
}
```

### Explanation:

**Assumptions:**
- `!(pressL && pressR)`: This line ensures mutual exclusivity between pressing the left (`pressL`) and right (`pressR`) buttons, meaning they cannot be pressed simultaneously which could otherwise cause conflicting rotation commands.

**Guarantees:**
- `pressL -> ([cube.rotation <- "left"] W pressR)`: This line guarantees that if the left button is pressed, the cube will begin rotating to the left. This rotation will continue until the right button is pressed.
- `pressR -> ([cube.rotation <- "right"] W pressL)`: Similarly, this ensures that if the right button is pressed, the cube will rotate to the right until the left button is pressed.

This TSL specification effectively controls the cube's rotation based on user input, preventing conflicts and ensuring smooth operation.
