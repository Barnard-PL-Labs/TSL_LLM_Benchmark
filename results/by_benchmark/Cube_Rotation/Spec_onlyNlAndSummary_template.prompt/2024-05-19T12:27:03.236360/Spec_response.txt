Here is the TSL specification for the described cube control system using left and right button inputs to manage the cube's rotation:

```tsl
always assume {
    // Ensure left and right buttons are not pressed simultaneously
    !(pressLeft && pressRight);
}

always guarantee {
    // If the left button is pressed, rotate left until the right button is pressed
    pressLeft -> ([cube.rotationDirection <- "left"] W pressRight);

    // If the right button is pressed, rotate right until the left button is pressed
    pressRight -> ([cube.rotationDirection <- "right"] W pressLeft);
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Assumptions:**
   - The system uses a mutual exclusion assumption to ensure that `pressLeft` and `pressRight` cannot be true at the same time, reflecting the requirement that both buttons are not pressed simultaneously.

2. **Guarantees:**
   - When the left button is pressed (`pressLeft`), the cube's rotation direction is set to "left". This state is maintained until the right button (`pressRight`) is pressed.
   - Similarly, when the right button is pressed, the cube's rotation direction is set to "right", and this continues until the left button is pressed again. 

The TSL specification ensures that the cube's rotation direction is controlled smoothly and accurately by the user, adhering to the constraints provided in the natural language description.
