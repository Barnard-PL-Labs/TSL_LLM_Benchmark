Here's the TSL specification for the control system described:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure that the left and right buttons are never pressed simultaneously
  !(pressLeft && pressRight);
}

always guarantee {
  // When the left button is pressed, rotate the cube to the left until the right button is pressed
  pressLeft -> ([cube.rotation <- "left"] W pressRight);

  // When the right button is pressed, rotate the cube to the right until the left button is pressed
  pressRight -> ([cube.rotation <- "right"] W pressLeft);
}
```

This TSL code captures the exclusive interaction between the left and right buttons, ensuring that the cube rotates in one direction at a time, changing only when the opposite button is pressed, thus fulfilling the requirements stated in the natural language description.
