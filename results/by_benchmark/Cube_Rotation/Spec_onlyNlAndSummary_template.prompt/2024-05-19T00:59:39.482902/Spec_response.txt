Here's how you would translate the described behavior into a TSL specification:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure that the left and right buttons are never pressed at the same time
  !(pressLeft && pressRight);
}

always guarantee {
  // If the left button is pressed, initiate rotation to the left and maintain until the right button is pressed
  pressLeft -> ([cube.rotate <- "left"] W pressRight);

  // If the right button is pressed, initiate rotation to the right and maintain until the left button is pressed
  pressRight -> ([cube.rotate <- "right"] W pressLeft);
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Assumptions**:
  - The system must ensure mutual exclusivity between the left and right button presses. This is achieved using a logical negation (`!`) combined with a logical and (`&&`), ensuring that both `pressLeft` and `pressRight` cannot be true at the same time.

- **Guarantees**:
  - For the left button (`pressLeft`), the cube's rotation direction is set to "left". This state persists until the right button is pressed (`pressRight`), as indicated by the Weak Until (`W`) operator. This means the cube continues rotating to the left unless interrupted by the pressing of the opposite button.
  - Similarly, for the right button (`pressRight`), the cube starts rotating to the right and continues to do so until the left button (`pressLeft`) is pressed.

This TSL specification captures the key functionality of the control system, ensuring that the cubeâ€™s rotation can be smoothly and accurately controlled by the user, while preventing any conflicts that may arise from simultaneous button presses.
