Below is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description for managing the rotation of a cube using left and right buttons:

```tsl
always assume {
  // It is assumed that the left and right buttons are never pressed simultaneously
  !(pressLeft && pressRight);
}

always guarantee {
  // When the left button is pressed, the cube begins rotating to the left. 
  // This rotation continues until the right button is pressed.
  pressLeft -> ([cube.rotation <- "left"] W pressRight);

  // Similarly, when the right button is pressed, the cube begins rotating to the right.
  // This rotation continues until the left button is pressed.
  pressRight -> ([cube.rotation <- "right"] W pressLeft);
}
```

This TSL code clearly defines the assumptions and guarantees required for controlling the cube's rotation:
- The mutual exclusion of button presses ensures that no conflicting commands are given to the cube.
- The guarantees define the behavior of the cube's rotation in response to the buttons being pressed, maintaining the specified rotation until the opposite button is pressed. This allows for a smooth and controlled adjustment of the cubeâ€™s orientation as per user input.
