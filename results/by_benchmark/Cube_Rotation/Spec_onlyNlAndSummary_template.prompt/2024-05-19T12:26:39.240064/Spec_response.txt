Here is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Assume that the left and right buttons are never pressed at the same time.
  !(pressLeft && pressRight);
}

always guarantee {
  // If the left button is pressed, the cube should begin rotating to the left.
  // This rotation should continue until the right button is pressed.
  pressLeft -> ([cube.rotation <- "left"] W pressRight);

  // Similarly, if the right button is pressed, the cube should rotate to the right
  // until the left button is pressed.
  pressRight -> ([cube.rotation <- "right"] W pressLeft);

  // Ensure mutual exclusion of rotation commands to prevent conflicts.
  pressLeft -> !([cube.rotation <- "right"]);
  pressRight -> !([cube.rotation <- "left"]);
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Assumptions**: The system assumes mutual exclusion between pressing the left and right buttons. This prevents simultaneous presses, which could potentially cause undefined behavior in the cube's rotation logic.
- **Guarantees**:
  - **Rotating Left**: When the left button (`pressLeft`) is pressed, the cube's rotation direction is set to "left", and this direction is maintained until the right button (`pressRight`) is pressed.
  - **Rotating Right**: Conversely, when the right button is pressed, the cube's rotation direction is set to "right", which holds until the left button is pressed.
  - **Conflicting Commands**: Additional guarantees ensure that conflicting rotation commands are not issued simultaneously, preserving smooth and accurate control of the cube's rotation.

This specification effectively manages the cube's rotational direction based on user input while ensuring a conflict-free control mechanism.
