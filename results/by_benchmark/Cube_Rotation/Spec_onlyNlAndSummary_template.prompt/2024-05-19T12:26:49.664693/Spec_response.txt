Here is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description:

```
always assume {
  // Ensure that the left and right buttons are never pressed at the same time
  !(pressLeft && pressRight);
}

always guarantee {
  // If the left button is pressed, rotate the cube to the left and continue until the right button is pressed
  pressLeft -> ([cube.rotation <- "left"] W pressRight);

  // If the right button is pressed, rotate the cube to the right and continue until the left button is pressed
  pressRight -> ([cube.rotation <- "right"] W pressLeft);
}
```

This TSL code meets the described requirements by ensuring mutual exclusion of button presses and managing the cube's rotation direction according to which button is pressed. Each button press initiates a rotation in one direction, which is maintained until the opposite button is pressed.
