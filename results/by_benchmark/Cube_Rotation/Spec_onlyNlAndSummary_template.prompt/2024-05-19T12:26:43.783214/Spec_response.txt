Here is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Assume that left and right buttons are never pressed simultaneously
  !(pressLeft && pressRight);
}

always guarantee {
  // If the left button is pressed, the cube should rotate to the left until the right button is pressed
  pressLeft -> ([cube.rotationDirection <- "left"] W pressRight);

  // If the right button is pressed, the cube should rotate to the right until the left button is pressed
  pressRight -> ([cube.rotationDirection <- "right"] W pressLeft);
}
```

This TSL specification defines the interaction between the two buttons and the cube's rotation direction as described. The use of the weak until `W` ensures that the rotation direction continues in the specified direction until the opposite button is pressed, without requiring the opposite button to ever be pressed, thus providing a default ongoing action.
