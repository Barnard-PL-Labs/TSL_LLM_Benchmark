Below is the TSL specification that reflects the natural language description you provided for a control system managing a cube's rotation influenced by two buttons (left and right):

```tsl
always assume {
  //Ensure that the left and right buttons are never pressed simultaneously
  !(pressL && pressR);
}

always guarantee {
  //When the left button is pressed, begin rotating the cube to the left, and continue until the right button is pressed
  pressL -> ([cube.rotation <- "left"] W pressR);

  //When the right button is pressed, begin rotating the cube to the right, and continue until the left button is pressed
  pressR -> ([cube.rotation <- "right"] W pressL);
}
```

### Breakdown of TSL Code:

**Assumptions:**
1. `!(pressL && pressR)`: This line ensures that the left (`pressL`) and right (`pressR`) buttons are never pressed at the same time, which prevents conflicting commands.

**Guarantees:**
1. `pressL -> ([cube.rotation <- "left"] W pressR)`: This line specifies that when the left button is pressed, the cube should start rotating to the left. This left rotation will continue until the right button is pressed.
2. `pressR -> ([cube.rotation <- "right"] W pressL)`: This line specifies that when the right button is pressed, the cube should start rotating to the right. This right rotation will continue until the left button is pressed.

This TSL specification ensures that the cube's rotation direction is controlled smoothly and accurately based on user input, with a guarantee that no conflicting rotation commands occur simultaneously.
