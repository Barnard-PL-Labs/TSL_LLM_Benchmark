Here is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description for controlling the cube's rotation with left and right buttons:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensuring that left and right buttons are not pressed at the same time
  !(pressLeft && pressRight);
}

always guarantee {
  // If the left button is pressed, rotate the cube to the left until the right button is pressed
  pressLeft -> ([cube.rotation <- "left"] W pressRight);

  // If the right button is pressed, rotate the cube to the right until the left button is pressed
  pressRight -> ([cube.rotation <- "right"] W pressLeft);
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Assumptions**: The code specifies that the left (`pressLeft`) and right (`pressRight`) buttons cannot be pressed simultaneously. This is enforced by the assumption `!(pressLeft && pressRight)`.
- **Guarantees**: 
  - When the left button is pressed (`pressLeft`), it triggers the cube to rotate to the left (`[cube.rotation <- "left"]`). This rotation continues until the right button is pressed (`W pressRight`).
  - Similarly, when the right button is pressed (`pressRight`), the cube rotates to the right (`[cube.rotation <- "right"]`). This rotation persists until the left button is pressed (`W pressLeft`).
- This TSL specification ensures that the cube's rotation is controlled distinctly by each button, avoiding any overlap or simultaneous conflicting commands. This allows for a smooth and accurate control over the cube's rotation direction.
