Here is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure that the left and right buttons are never pressed simultaneously
  !(pressLeft && pressRight);
}

always guarantee {
  // When the left button is pressed, start rotating the cube left; continue until the right button is pressed
  pressLeft -> ([cube.rotation <- "left"] W pressRight);

  // When the right button is pressed, start rotating the cube right; continue until the left button is pressed
  pressRight -> ([cube.rotation <- "right"] W pressLeft);
}
```

This TSL code snippet captures the logic of how the cube's rotation is influenced by the left and right button presses, ensuring that their effects are mutually exclusive and persist until the opposite button is activated.
