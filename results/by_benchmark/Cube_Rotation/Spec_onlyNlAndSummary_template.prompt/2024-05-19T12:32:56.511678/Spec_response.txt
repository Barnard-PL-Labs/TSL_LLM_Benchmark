```
always assume {
  // Ensure that the left and right buttons are never pressed simultaneously
  !(pressLeft && pressRight);
}

always guarantee {
  // If the left button is pressed, rotate the cube to the left until the right button is pressed
  pressLeft -> ([cube.rotation.direction <- "left"] W pressRight);
  
  // If the right button is pressed, rotate the cube to the right until the left button is pressed
  pressRight -> ([cube.rotation.direction <- "right"] W pressLeft);
}
```

This TSL specification accurately represents the control system for the cube as described. It ensures that the cubeâ€™s rotation is controlled smoothly by preventing simultaneous presses of the left and right buttons and managing the rotation directions until the opposite button is pressed.
