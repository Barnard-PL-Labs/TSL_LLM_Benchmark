Here is the TSL specification derived from the provided natural language description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Assume that the left and right buttons are never pressed simultaneously
  !(pressLeft && pressRight);
}

always guarantee {
  // Guarantee that when the left button is pressed, the cube rotates left
  // until the right button is pressed
  pressLeft -> ([cube.rotation <- "left"] W pressRight);

  // Guarantee that when the right button is pressed, the cube rotates right
  // until the left button is pressed
  pressRight -> ([cube.rotation <- "right"] W pressLeft);
}
```

This TSL script describes a controller for a rotating cube, where pressing either the left or right button influences the direction of the rotation and ensures that conflicting commands (both buttons pressed simultaneously) are not accepted. It uses the weak until operator (`W`) to maintain the current rotation command until the opposite command is issued.
