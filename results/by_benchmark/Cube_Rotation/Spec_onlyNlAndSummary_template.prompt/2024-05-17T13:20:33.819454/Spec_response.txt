Here is the TSL specification based on the given natural language description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure left and right buttons are not pressed simultaneously
  !(pressLeft && pressRight);
}

always guarantee {
  // If the left button is pressed, rotate to the left until the right button is pressed
  pressLeft -> ([cube.rotation <- "left"] W pressRight);

  // If the right button is pressed, rotate to the right until the left button is pressed
  pressRight -> ([cube.rotation <- "right"] W pressLeft);
}
```

This TSL code reflects the rules for managing the cube's rotation through left and right button presses, ensuring that the rotations are exclusive and maintained until the opposite button is pressed.
