Here is the TSL specification based on your description of a control system for a cube controlled by two buttons:

```tsl
always assume {
  // It is assumed that both buttons are never pressed at the same time.
  !(pressLeft && pressRight);
}

always guarantee {
  // When the left button is pressed, the cube begins to rotate to the left.
  // This rotation continues until the right button is pressed.
  pressLeft -> ([cube.rotation <- "left"] W pressRight);

  // When the right button is pressed, the cube begins to rotate to the right.
  // This rotation continues until the left button is pressed.
  pressRight -> ([cube.rotation <- "right"] W pressLeft);
}
```

This TSL specification meets all the requirements outlined in the natural language description:
- It ensures mutual exclusion of button presses.
- It controls the rotation direction of the cube based on the button pressed, and maintains the rotation until the opposite button is pressed.
