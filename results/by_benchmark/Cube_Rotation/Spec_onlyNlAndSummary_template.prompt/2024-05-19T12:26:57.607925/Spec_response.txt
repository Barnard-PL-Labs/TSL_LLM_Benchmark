Here is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure left and right buttons are never pressed simultaneously
  !(pressLeft && pressRight);
}

always guarantee {
  // When left button is pressed, rotate cube to the left until the right button is pressed
  pressLeft -> ([cube.rotation <- "left"] W pressRight);

  // When right button is pressed, rotate cube to the right until the left button is pressed
  pressRight -> ([cube.rotation <- "right"] W pressLeft);
}
```

This TSL code sets up the expected behavior for a control system handling a cube's rotation based on left and right button inputs, ensuring that the rotation continues in one direction until the opposite button is pressed, while avoiding simultaneous presses of both buttons.
