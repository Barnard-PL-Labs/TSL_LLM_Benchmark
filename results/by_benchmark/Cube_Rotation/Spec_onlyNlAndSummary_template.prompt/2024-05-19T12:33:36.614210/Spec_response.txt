Here is the TSL specification based on the natural language description provided for the cube control system with left and right buttons influencing rotation:

```
always assume {
  // Ensure that the left and right buttons are never pressed simultaneously
  !(pressLeft && pressRight);
}

always guarantee {
  // If the left button is pressed, make the cube rotate left until the right button is pressed
  pressLeft -> ([cube.rotation <- "left"] W pressRight);

  // If the right button is pressed, make the cube rotate right until the left button is pressed
  pressRight -> ([cube.rotation <- "right"] W pressLeft);
}
```

This TSL specification captures the assumptions and guarantees for a cube control system where left and right buttons influence the cube's rotation direction, ensuring no simultaneous button presses and maintaining rotation direction until the opposite button is pressed.
