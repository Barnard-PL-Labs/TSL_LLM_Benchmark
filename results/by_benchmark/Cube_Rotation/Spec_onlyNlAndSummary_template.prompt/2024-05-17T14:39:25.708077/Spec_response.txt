Here is the TSL specification for the control system described:

```
always assume {
  // Ensure left and right buttons are never pressed simultaneously
  !(pressLeft && pressRight);
}

always guarantee {
  // If the left button is pressed, rotate left until the right button is pressed
  pressLeft -> ([cube.rotation <- "left"] W pressRight);

  // If the right button is pressed, rotate right until the left button is pressed
  pressRight -> ([cube.rotation <- "right"] W pressLeft);
}
```
