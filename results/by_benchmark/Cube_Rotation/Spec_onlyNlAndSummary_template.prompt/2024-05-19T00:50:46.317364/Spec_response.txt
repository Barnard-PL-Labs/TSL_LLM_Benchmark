Here is a TSL specification that captures the described behavior of the cube control system using left and right buttons:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Assumption that left and right buttons are never pressed simultaneously
  !(pressLeft && pressRight);
}

always guarantee {
  // Guarantees for rotation control based on button presses
  pressLeft -> ([cube.rotation <- "left"] W pressRight);
  pressRight -> ([cube.rotation <- "right"] W pressLeft);
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Assumptions**:
  - The `!(pressLeft && pressRight);` assumption ensures that the system considers it impossible for both the left and right buttons to be pressed at the same time. This is a safety and logic constraint to prevent conflicting commands.

- **Guarantees**:
  - `pressLeft -> ([cube.rotation <- "left"] W pressRight);` specifies that if the left button is pressed, the cube will start and continue rotating to the left until the right button is pressed.
  - Similarly, `pressRight -> ([cube.rotation <- "right"] W pressLeft);` ensures that pressing the right button causes the cube to rotate to the right until the left button is pressed.

This setup uses the weak until (`W`) operator to maintain the current rotation direction until the opposite button is pressed, ensuring smooth and uninterrupted control over the cube's rotation direction.
