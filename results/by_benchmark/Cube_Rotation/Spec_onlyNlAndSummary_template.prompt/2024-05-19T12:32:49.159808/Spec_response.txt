Here's how you can translate the provided natural language description into a TSL specification for the cube control system:

```TSL
always assume {
    // It must be assumed that the left and right buttons are never pressed simultaneously
    !(pressLeft && pressRight);
}

always guarantee {
    // If the left button is pressed, the cube begins rotating to the left, continuing until the right button is pressed
    pressLeft -> ([cube.rotation <- "left"] W pressRight);

    // If the right button is pressed, the cube begins rotating to the right, continuing until the left button is pressed
    pressRight -> ([cube.rotation <- "right"] W pressLeft);
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Assumptions**: The `!(pressLeft && pressRight)` ensures that there is a mutual exclusion between the left and right button presses, meaning both cannot be true at the same time.
  
- **Guarantees**:
  - `pressLeft -> ([cube.rotation <- "left"] W pressRight)` states that when the left button is pressed, the cube should start rotating left. This rotation will continue until the right button is pressed.
  - `pressRight -> ([cube.rotation <- "right"] W pressLeft)` specifies that when the right button is pressed, the cube should begin to rotate right, and this will continue until the left button is pressed.

This TSL specification encompasses all the requirements as described in the natural language description, ensuring smooth and conflict-free control over the cube's rotation direction based on user input.
