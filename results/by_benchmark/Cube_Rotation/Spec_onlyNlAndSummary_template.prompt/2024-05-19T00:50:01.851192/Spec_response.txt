Here is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description for the cube control system:

```
always assume {
  // Assume that the left and right buttons are never pressed at the same time
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // When the left button is pressed, rotate the cube to the left until the right button is pressed
  pressL(e) -> [cube.rotation <- "left"] W pressR(e);

  // When the right button is pressed, rotate the cube to the right until the left button is pressed
  pressR(e) -> [cube.rotation <- "right"] W pressL(e);
}
```

This specification models the system's behavior as follows:

- It ensures mutual exclusion between the left and right button presses.
- It controls the cube's rotation direction based on the button pressed and maintains that rotation until the opposite button is pressed, allowing for a controlled and conflict-free user interaction with the cube's rotation controls.
