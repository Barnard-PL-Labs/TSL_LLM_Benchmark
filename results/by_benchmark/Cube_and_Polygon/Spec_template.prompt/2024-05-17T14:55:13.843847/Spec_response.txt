Here is the TSL specification based on the provided description and the given functions and predicates:

```tsl
always assume {
  // It is assumed that the left and right buttons are never pressed at the same time
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // When the right key is pressed, increment the count value by 0.1 continuously until the left key is pressed
  pressR(e) -> ([count <- count + 0.1] W pressL(e));

  // When the left key is pressed, decrement the count value by 0.1 continuously until the right key is pressed
  pressL(e) -> ([count <- count - 0.1] W pressR(e));

  // The cube's rotation along the y-axis is set to the sine of twice the count value, continuously updating as count changes
  [cube.rotation.y <- sin(2 * count)];

  // The polygon's rotation along the y-axis follows a sawtooth pattern calculated as the saw of 0.5 times (1 + count), continuously updating as count changes
  [polygon.rotation.y <- saw(0.5 * (1 + count))];

  // The x-position of the cube is fixed at 1
  [cube.position.x <- 1];

  // The x-position of the polygon is fixed at 3
  [polygon.position.x <- 3];
}
```

This TSL specification defines the dynamic and static properties of the graphical objects based on user inputs and ensures that the left and right keys cannot be activated simultaneously. The continuous updates to the `count` value and its influence on the graphical transformations maintain the dynamic visual effect as described.
