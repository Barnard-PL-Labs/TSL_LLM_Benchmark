Below is the TSL specification derived from the provided description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // It is assumed that the left and right buttons are never pressed simultaneously.
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // When the right key is pressed, increment the count by 0.1 until the left key is pressed.
  pressR(e) -> ([count <- count + 0.1] W pressL(e));
  
  // When the left key is pressed, decrement the count by 0.1 until the right key is pressed.
  pressL(e) -> ([count <- count - 0.1] W pressR(e));
  
  // The rotation of the cube along the y-axis follows the sine of twice the count value.
  [cube.rotation.y <- sin(2 * count)];
  
  // The rotation of the polygon along the y-axis follows a sawtooth pattern of 0.5 times (1 plus the count value).
  [polygon.rotation.y <- saw(0.5 * (1 + count))];
  
  // The x-position of the cube is fixed at 1.
  [cube.position.x <- 1];
  
  // The x-position of the polygon is fixed at 3.
  [polygon.position.x <- 3];
}
```

This TSL specification takes into account the user inputs from the left and right keys to modify a "count" which influences the rotations of the cube and polygon based on sinusoidal and sawtooth wave functions, respectively. It also sets fixed positions for the cube and polygon as per the description. The logic handles the mutual exclusion of left and right key presses and updates the system state continuously based on these inputs.
