Here is the TSL specification based on the natural language description provided:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure that the left and right buttons are never pressed at the same time
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // When the right key is pressed, increment the count by 0.1 continuously until the left key is pressed
  pressR(e) -> ([count <- count + 0.1] W pressL(e));
  
  // When the left key is pressed, decrement the count by 0.1 continuously until the right key is pressed
  pressL(e) -> ([count <- count - 0.1] W pressR(e));
  
  // The rotation of the cube along the y-axis is set to the sine of twice the count value
  [cube.rotation.y <- sin(2 * count)];
  
  // The rotation of a polygon along the y-axis is set to sawtooth pattern, calculated as the saw of 0.5 times (1 plus the count value)
  [polygon.rotation.y <- saw(0.5 * (1 + count))];
  
  // The x-position of the cube is fixed at 1
  [cube.position.x <- 1];
  
  // The x-position of the polygon is fixed at 3
  [polygon.position.x <- 3];
}
```

This TSL specification encapsulates the assumed mutual exclusivity between the left and right button presses, the dynamic adjustments to the 'count' variable based on those button presses, and the static and dynamic positioning and rotation of the cube and polygon as described.
