To implement the given functions and predicates as JavaScript code, we need to define JavaScript functions that interact with the 3D cube environment and handle event listeners for button presses. Below are the detailed implementations for each function and predicate using the given descriptions.

### Functions
1. **sin(x)** - This function takes a parameter `x` and returns the sine of `x`. JavaScript provides a built-in `Math.sin()` method for this purpose.

```javascript
function sin(x) {
    return Math.sin(x);
}
```

2. **saw(x)** - The sawtooth wave function can be constructed by taking the fractional part of `x`. However, to create a continuous sawtooth wave that cycles between `-1` and `1` based on `x`, you can use the following formula.

```javascript
function saw(x) {
    return 2 * (x - Math.floor(x + 0.5)) ;
}
```

### Predicates
Predicates are functions supposed to return a boolean value. For button press events, we can assume you have some mechanism to detect these (such as event listeners in a web environment). The implementation below assumes that buttons invoke these predicates when they are pressed.

1. **pressL(e)** - Returns true when the left button is pressed. Assuming an event listener setup:

```javascript
function pressL(e) {
    // Assuming 'e' is the event object and 'e.key' gives the pressed key
    return e.key === 'ArrowLeft';
}
```

2. **pressR(e)** - Returns true when the right button is pressed. Similarly to `pressL(e)`:

```javascript
function pressR(e) {
    return e.key === 'ArrowRight';
}
```

### Event Listener Setup
To use these predicates effectively, you'll need to set up event listeners that call these functions when keys are pressed. Hereâ€™s how you might set it up in a web environment:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(e) {
    if (pressL(e)) {
        console.log('Left button pressed');
        // additional logic can be implemented here
    }
    if (pressR(e)) {
        console.log('Right button pressed');
        // additional logic can be implemented here
    }
});
```

### 3D Cube Interaction
To demonstrate an example interaction with the cube's `scale.x` using the `sin` function (assuming a variable `cube` represents the 3D cube object and `t` is a time or frame count variable):

```javascript
function updateCubeScale(t) {
    cube.scale.x = sin(t); // Adjusting the cube's scale along x-axis using the sine function
}
```

This setup assumes you have a `cube` object available in your 3D environment where `cube.scale.x` can be directly manipulated. The `updateCubeScale` function would need to be called regularly, perhaps in a rendering loop.
