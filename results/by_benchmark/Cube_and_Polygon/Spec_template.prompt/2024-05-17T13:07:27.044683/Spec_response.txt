Here is the TSL specification based on your description:

```tsl
always assume {
    !(pressL(e) && pressR(e)); // The left and right buttons are never pressed simultaneously.
}

always guarantee {
    pressR(e) -> ([count <- count + 0.1] W pressL(e)); // When right key is pressed, increment count by 0.1 until left key is pressed.
    pressL(e) -> ([count <- count - 0.1] W pressR(e)); // When left key is pressed, decrement count by 0.1 until right key is pressed.
    [cube.rotation.y <- sin(2 * count)]; // Cube's rotation on y-axis follows the sine of twice the count value.
    [polygon.rotation.y <- saw(0.5 * (1 + count))]; // Polygon's rotation on y-axis follows the sawtooth pattern of 0.5 times (1 plus count value).
    [cube.position.x <- 1]; // Cube's x-position is fixed at 1.
    [polygon.position.x <- 3]; // Polygon's x-position is fixed at 3.
}
```

This TSL specification includes assumptions to prevent simultaneous button presses and guarantees to manage the graphical updates based on the user interaction and predefined functions.
