Based on the natural language description and the given information on functions and predicates, here is the TSL specification for the graphical interface:

```TSL
always assume {
  // Assumption that left and right buttons are never pressed simultaneously
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // When the right key is pressed, increment the count by 0.1 until the left key is pressed
  pressR(e) -> ([count <- count + 0.1] W pressL(e));

  // When the left key is pressed, decrement the count by 0.1 until the right key is pressed
  pressL(e) -> ([count <- count - 0.1] W pressR(e));

  // Continuous update of the cube's rotation based on the sine of twice the count value
  [cube.rotation.y <- sin(2 * count)];

  // Continuous update of the polygon's rotation based on the sawtooth of 0.5 times (1 + count)
  [polygon.rotation.y <- saw(0.5 * (1 + count))];

  // Fixed x-positions of the cube and the polygon
  [cube.position.x <- 1];
  [polygon.position.x <- 3];
}
```

This specification meets all the described requirements. Here are the key aspects reflected:

1. Mutual exclusion of pressing left and right keys.
2. Incremental and decremental update of a count variable on pressing right and left keys, respectively.
3. Continuous update of the graphical rotation of both the cube and the polygon based on the count variable, using sinusoidal and sawtooth functions.
4. Fixed positions for the cube and polygon to maintain geometric consistency in the scene.
