To implement the specified JavaScript methods using the given API and requirements, I'll provide code for both the "functions" and "predicates" sections. Here's how you can integrate these functionalities:

### Functions
1. **sin(x)**: This function will simply return the sine of `x` using the Math library in JavaScript.
2. **saw(x)**: This function will implement the sawtooth wave, which can be computed as `x - Math.floor(x)` for a normalized version that oscillates between 0 and 1.

```javascript
// Function to return the sine of x
function sin(x) {
    return Math.sin(x);
}

// Function to return the sawtooth wave of x
function saw(x) {
    return x - Math.floor(x);
}
```

### Predicates
These predicates will check for button presses. Since you mentioned that the event listener should be inside the function, we'll set up a simple event handling system that updates flags when keys are pressed and released.

```javascript
// Predicates for button presses using event listeners
let leftPressed = false;
let rightPressed = false;

// Event listeners to update the flags based on key presses
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(e) {
    if (e.key === 'ArrowLeft') {  // Assuming 'ArrowLeft' for the left button
        leftPressed = true;
    }
    if (e.key === 'ArrowRight') { // Assuming 'ArrowRight' for the right button
        rightPressed = true;
    }
});

document.addEventListener('keyup', function(e) {
    if (e.key === 'ArrowLeft') {
        leftPressed = false;
    }
    if (e.key === 'ArrowRight') {
        rightPressed = false;
    }
});

// Predicate functions
function pressL(e) {
    return leftPressed;
}

function pressR(e) {
    return rightPressed;
}
```

### Summary
- The **functions** (`sin` and `saw`) use standard JavaScript Math operations to perform calculations.
- The **predicates** (`pressL` and `pressR`) use a global flag approach where key events toggle the state of these flags. Since JavaScript event handlers cannot be directly placed inside function calls due to their asynchronous nature, we use flags that are updated on `keydown` and `keyup` events. This allows the `pressL` and `pressR` functions to simply return the current state of these flags.

This setup ensures that your system can dynamically check if either the left or right button is pressed at any given moment, operating under the constraints provided by typical web API behaviors in JavaScript.
