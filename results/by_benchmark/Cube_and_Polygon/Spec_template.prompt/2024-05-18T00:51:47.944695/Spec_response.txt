Here is the TSL specification based on the given natural language description and the provided functions and predicates:

```TSL
always assume {
  // Assume that left and right buttons are never pressed simultaneously.
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // When the right key is pressed, increment the count value by 0.1.
  // This increment continues until the left key is pressed.
  pressR(e) -> ([count <- count + 0.1] W pressL(e));

  // When the left key is pressed, decrement the count value by 0.1.
  // This decrement continues until the right key is pressed.
  pressL(e) -> ([count <- count - 0.1] W pressR(e));

  // The rotation of the cube along the y-axis is set to the sine of twice the count value.
  // Continuously updating as count changes.
  [cube.rotation.y <- sin(2 * count)];

  // The rotation of a polygon along the y-axis follows a sawtooth pattern,
  // which is calculated as the saw of 0.5 times (1 plus the count value).
  // Continuously updating as count changes.
  [polygon.rotation.y <- saw(0.5 * (1 + count))];

  // The x-position of the cube is fixed at 1.
  [cube.position.x <- 1];

  // The x-position of the polygon is fixed at 3.
  [polygon.position.x <- 3];
}
```

This TSL specification captures the dynamic behavior of the graphical objects (cube and polygon) in response to user inputs while ensuring that the geometric positioning remains fixed as described. The interaction between the count adjustment and the continuous rotation update mechanisms is clearly defined, ensuring an ongoing visual dynamic in the graphical interface.
