Here is the TSL specification based on your detailed description of the graphical interface and its behavior in response to user inputs:

```tsl
always assume {
    // The left and right buttons are never pressed at the same time
    !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
    // When the right key is pressed, increment the count by 0.1 until the left key is pressed
    pressR(e) -> ([count <- count + 0.1] W pressL(e));
    
    // When the left key is pressed, decrement the count by 0.1 until the right key is pressed
    pressL(e) -> ([count <- count - 0.1] W pressR(e));
    
    // Continuous updates of the cube's rotation along the y-axis based on the sine of twice the count
    [cube.rotation.y <- sin(2 * count)];
    
    // Continuous updates of the polygon's rotation along the y-axis based on the sawtooth of 0.5 times (1 plus the count)
    [polygon.rotation.y <- saw(0.5 * (1 + count))];
    
    // The x-position of the cube is fixed at 1
    [cube.position.x <- 1];
    
    // The x-position of the polygon is fixed at 3
    [polygon.position.x <- 3];
}
```

In this TSL spec:
- The `always assume` block ensures that mutual exclusion is maintained between the left and right button presses.
- The `always guarantee` block defines how the system should react to the button presses, updating the graphical elements (cube and polygon) as per the mathematical functions described. It also sets the static positions of these elements.
