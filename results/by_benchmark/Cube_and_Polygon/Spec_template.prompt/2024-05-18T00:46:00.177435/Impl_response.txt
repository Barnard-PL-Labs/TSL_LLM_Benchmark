To implement the requested functions and predicates using JavaScript, we'll need to provide detailed implementations for the `sin(x)`, `saw(x)`, `pressL(e)`, and `pressR(e)` functions. Below you will find the JavaScript code required to define these functions based on the provided API and specifications:

### Functions

1. **sin(x)** - This function returns the sine of a given angle `x`, where `x` is in radians.

```javascript
function sin(x) {
    return Math.sin(x);
}
```

2. **saw(x)** - This function returns the sawtooth wave value for a given input `x`. The sawtooth wave can be calculated using a simple periodic function with a period of `2π`.

```javascript
function saw(x) {
    return 2 * (x / (2 * Math.PI) - Math.floor(0.5 + x / (2 * Math.PI)));
}
```

### Predicates

For the predicates, since we're dealing with event listeners, we'll assume that `e` is the event object. We will simulate an environment where `pressL` and `pressR` listen for key press events and check if the left or right arrow keys are pressed, respectively.

1. **pressL(e)** - Returns true if the left arrow key is pressed.

```javascript
function pressL(e) {
    return e.key === 'ArrowLeft';
}
```

2. **pressR(e)** - Returns true if the right arrow key is pressed.

```javascript
function pressR(e) {
    return e.key === 'ArrowRight';
}
```

### Using the API (Setting Cube Scale)

To demonstrate the integration with the cube's scale using the API (e.g., setting `cube.scale.x` when specific conditions are met), you can tie these functions into event listeners or other logic in your application.

For example, setting cube scale based on a sine or sawtooth wave could be implemented as follows:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('keypress', function(e) {
    if (pressL(e)) {
        cube.scale.x = sin(Math.PI); // Set scale based on the sine function
    } else if (pressR(e)) {
        cube.scale.x = saw(Math.PI); // Set scale based on the sawtooth function
    }
});
```

This code snippet listens for keypress events, checks if the left or right arrow key is pressed, and then sets the `cube.scale.x` based on the sine or sawtooth wave value of π, respectively.

This implementation should provide a basic framework for how to integrate the functions and predicates with the system API you are using, specifically for manipulating `cube.scale.x`. Adjustments may be needed based on the exact setup and requirements of your environment.
