Here is the TSL specification based on the requirements and natural language description provided:

```tsl
always assume {
  // it is assumed that the left and right buttons are never pressed at the same time
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // When the right key is pressed, increment the count by 0.1 until the left key is pressed
  pressR(e) -> ([count <- count + 0.1] W pressL(e));
  
  // When the left key is pressed, decrement the count by 0.1 until the right key is pressed
  pressL(e) -> ([count <- count - 0.1] W pressR(e));
  
  // The cube's rotation along the y-axis is set as the sine of twice the count
  [cube.rotation.y <- sin(2 * count)];
  
  // The polygon's rotation along the y-axis is set as the sawtooth of 0.5 times (1 plus the count)
  [polygon.rotation.y <- saw(0.5 * (1 + count))];
  
  // The cube's x-position is fixed at 1
  [cube.position.x <- 1];
  
  // The polygon's x-position is fixed at 3
  [polygon.position.x <- 3];
}
```

This TSL specification reflects the dynamic interactions and continuous updating of rotations for graphical objects based on user input, as well as maintaining fixed positions for a visually structured scene. The assumptions ensure the mutual exclusivity of left and right button presses, while the guarantees handle the logic for incrementing or decrementing counts and applying these counts to graphical transformations.
