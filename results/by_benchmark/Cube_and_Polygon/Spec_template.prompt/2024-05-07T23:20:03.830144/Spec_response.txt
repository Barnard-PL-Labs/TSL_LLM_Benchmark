Here is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description, assumptions, and guarantees:

```tsl
always assume {
    // The left and right buttons are never pressed simultaneously
    !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
    // When the right key is pressed, increment the count by 0.1 until the left key is pressed
    pressR(e) -> ([count <- count + 0.1] W pressL(e));

    // When the left key is pressed, decrement the count by 0.1 until the right key is pressed
    pressL(e) -> ([count <- count - 0.1] W pressR(e));

    // The rotation of the cube along the y-axis follows the sine of twice the count value
    [cube.rotation.y <- sin(2 * count)];

    // The rotation of the polygon along the y-axis follows a sawtooth pattern based on 0.5 times (1 plus the count value)
    [polygon.rotation.y <- saw(0.5 * (1 + count))];

    // The x-position of the cube is fixed at 1
    [cube.position.x <- 1];

    // The x-position of the polygon is fixed at 3
    [polygon.position.x <- 3];
}
```

This TSL specification sets up an environment where user input from right and left keys dynamically modifies a numerical `count`, which then controls the rotation of the cube and polygon. The rotation of these objects is continuously updated based on sinusoidal and sawtooth functions. Furthermore, it maintains fixed x-positions for both the cube and polygon in the scene.
