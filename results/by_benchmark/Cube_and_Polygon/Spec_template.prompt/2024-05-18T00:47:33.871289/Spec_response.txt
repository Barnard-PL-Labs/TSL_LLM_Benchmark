Here's the TSL specification based on your requirements:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Assume that the left and right buttons are never pressed at the same time
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Guarantee that when the right key is pressed, the count increments by 0.1 until the left key is pressed
  pressR(e) -> ([count <- count + 0.1] W pressL(e));

  // Guarantee that when the left key is pressed, the count decrements by 0.1 until the right key is pressed
  pressL(e) -> ([count <- count - 0.1] W pressR(e));

  // Guarantee that the cube's rotation along the y-axis is set to the sine of twice the count value
  [cube.rotation.y <- sin(2 * count)];

  // Guarantee that the polygon's rotation along the y-axis follows a sawtooth pattern of 0.5 times (1 plus the count value)
  [polygon.rotation.y <- saw(0.5 * (1 + count))];

  // Guarantee that the x-position of the cube is fixed at 1
  [cube.position.x <- 1];

  // Guarantee that the x-position of the polygon is fixed at 3
  [polygon.position.x <- 3];
}
```

This TSL specification fully encapsulates the dynamic behaviors and static positioning requirements you've described. It manages the relationships between user inputs and their effects on object rotations, ensuring that the rotations and positions are updated continuously and accurately according to the specified mathematical functions and user interactions.
