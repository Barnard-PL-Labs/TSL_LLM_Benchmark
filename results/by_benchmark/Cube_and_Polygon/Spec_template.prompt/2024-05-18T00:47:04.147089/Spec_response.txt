Here is the TSL specification based on the provided description and functions:

```tsl
always assume {
  // It is assumed that the left and right buttons are never pressed simultaneously
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Handling the increment of the count when the right key is pressed
  pressR(e) -> ([count <- count + 0.1] W pressL(e));

  // Handling the decrement of the count when the left key is pressed
  pressL(e) -> ([count <- count - 0.1] W pressR(e));

  // Setting the rotation of the cube based on the sine of twice the count value
  [cube.rotation.y <- sin(2 * count)];

  // Setting the rotation of the polygon based on the sawtooth pattern of 0.5 times (1 + count)
  [polygon.rotation.y <- saw(0.5 * (1 + count))];

  // Fixing the x-position of the cube
  [cube.position.x <- 1];

  // Fixing the x-position of the polygon
  [polygon.position.x <- 3];
}
```

This TSL specification covers all the requirements outlined in the natural language description, including the mutual exclusion of button presses, continuous modifications to object rotations based on sinusoidal and sawtooth functions, and static positioning of graphical objects.
