Here is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // It is assumed that left and right buttons are never pressed simultaneously.
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // When the right key is pressed, increment the count by 0.1 until the left key is pressed.
  pressR(e) -> ([count <- count + 0.1] W pressL(e));

  // When the left key is pressed, decrement the count by 0.1 until the right key is pressed.
  pressL(e) -> ([count <- count - 0.1] W pressR(e));

  // The rotation of the cube on the y-axis should follow the sine of twice the count value.
  [cube.rotation.y <- sin(2 * count)];

  // The rotation of the polygon on the y-axis should follow the sawtooth pattern of 0.5 times (1 + count).
  [polygon.rotation.y <- saw(0.5 * (1 + count))];

  // The x-position of the cube is fixed at 1.
  [cube.position.x <- 1];

  // The x-position of the polygon is fixed at 3.
  [polygon.position.x <- 3];
}
```

This TSL code effectively handles the dynamic rotation of the cube and the polygon based on user input from the left and right keys, while maintaining fixed positions for each object on the x-axis. The transformations for rotation are defined using mathematical functions directly in line with the manipulation of a count variable, which is updated based on the pressing of left or right buttons.
