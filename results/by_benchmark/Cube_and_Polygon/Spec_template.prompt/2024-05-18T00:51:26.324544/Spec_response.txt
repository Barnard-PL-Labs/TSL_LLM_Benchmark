Here's the TSL specification translated from your description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // It is never the case that both the left and right buttons are pressed simultaneously
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // When the right button is pressed, increment the count by 0.1
  // This continues until the left button is pressed
  pressR(e) -> ([count <- count + 0.1] W pressL(e));

  // When the left button is pressed, decrement the count by 0.1
  // This continues until the right button is pressed
  pressL(e) -> ([count <- count - 0.1] W pressR(e));

  // The rotation of the cube along the y-axis is set to the sine of twice the count value
  // This updates continuously as count changes
  [cube.rotation.y <- sin(2 * count)];

  // The rotation of the polygon along the y-axis follows a sawtooth pattern
  // This is calculated as the saw of 0.5 times (1 plus the count value)
  // This updates continuously as count changes
  [polygon.rotation.y <- saw(0.5 * (1 + count))];

  // The x-position of the cube is fixed at 1
  [cube.position.x <- 1];

  // The x-position of the polygon is fixed at 3
  [polygon.position.x <- 3];
}
```

This TSL specification effectively binds user interactions via the left and right keys to continuous transformations in the graphical elements (the cube and the polygon), adhering to the descriptions provided in the natural language specification while ensuring the necessary assumptions and guarantees.
