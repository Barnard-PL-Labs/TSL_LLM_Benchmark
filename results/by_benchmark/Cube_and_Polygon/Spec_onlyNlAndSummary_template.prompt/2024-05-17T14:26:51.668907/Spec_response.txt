Here's a TSL specification based on the provided natural language description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Define exclusive control by left and right keys
  !(pressR(e) && pressL(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Increase count for right key press
  pressR(e) -> ([count <- count + 0.1] W pressL(e));
  
  // Decrease count for left key press
  pressL(e) -> ([count <- count - 0.1] W pressR(e));
  
  // Cube rotation based on sine function of twice the count value
  [cube.rotation.y <- sin(2 * count)];
  
  // Polygon rotation based on a sawtooth function of 0.5 times (1 plus count)
  [polygon.rotation.y <- saw(0.5 * (1 + count))];
  
  // Static positions
  [cube.position.x <- 1];
  [polygon.position.x <- 3];
}
```

This TSL script ensures the following:
- The left and right keys cannot be pressed simultaneously.
- The count variable is incremented or decremented based on the right or left key press respectively, and this update continues until the opposite key is pressed.
- The cube's rotation on the y-axis is dynamically updated based on the sine of twice the count value.
- The polygon's rotation on the y-axis is updated using a sawtooth function of 0.5 times (1 plus the count value).
- The x-positions of the cube and polygon are set to fixed values to maintain static positions in the scene.
