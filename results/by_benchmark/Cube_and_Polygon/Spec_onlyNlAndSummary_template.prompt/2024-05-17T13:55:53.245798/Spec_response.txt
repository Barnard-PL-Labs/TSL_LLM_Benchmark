Here's the TSL specification based on the given natural language description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure that the left and right buttons cannot be pressed simultaneously
  !(pressR(e) && pressL(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Increment count by 0.1 and update rotation when the right key is pressed, until the left key is pressed
  pressR(e) -> ([count <- count + 0.1] && [cube.rotation.y <- sin(2 * count)] && [polygon.rotation.y <- saw(0.5 * (1 + count))]) W pressL(e);
  
  // Decrement count by 0.1 and update rotation when the left key is pressed, until the right key is pressed
  pressL(e) -> ([count <- count - 0.1] && [cube.rotation.y <- sin(2 * count)] && [polygon.rotation.y <- saw(0.5 * (1 + count))]) W pressR(e);
  
  // Set static positions for the cube and the polygon
  [cube.position.x <- 1];
  [polygon.position.x <- 3];
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Assumptions:**
   - The `always assume` block ensures that the left and right keys cannot be pressed at the same time, which prevents conflicting inputs that could disrupt the logical flow of the application.

2. **Guarantees:**
   - The `always guarantee` block contains rules for how the system should respond when the right or left keys are pressed.
   - When the right key is pressed (`pressR(e)`), three actions occur: the `count` variable is incremented by 0.1, and the y-axis rotations of the cube and the polygon are updated based on the new count value. The cube's rotation uses a sine function (`sin`), and the polygon's rotation uses a sawtooth function (`saw`). This update continues until the left key is pressed (`pressL(e)`), as indicated by the `Weak Until (W)` operator.
   - Similarly, when the left key is pressed, the count is decremented by 0.1, and the rotations are updated accordingly, continuing until the right key is pressed.
   - The x-positions of the cube and polygon are set to static values (1 for the cube and 3 for the polygon), ensuring they remain fixed in the scene while only their rotations are dynamically updated according to user inputs.
