Based on the provided APIs and requirements, I'll implement the functions and predicates using JavaScript. For the predicates `pressL(e)` and `pressR(e)`, I'll assume we are using these within an event-driven environment where `e` represents an event object from some user interface interactions. For the purpose of this example, these functions will be hooked up to keyboard events, checking for specific keys being pressed.

**Here is the implementation in JavaScript:**

```javascript
// Functions

/**
 * Returns the sine of x.
 * @param {number} x
 * @returns {number}
 */
function sin(x) {
    return Math.sin(x);
}

/**
 * Returns the sawtooth wave of x.
 * @param {number} x
 * @returns {number}
 */
function saw(x) {
    // Sawtooth wave can be represented as x - floor(x)
    return x - Math.floor(x);
}

// Predicates

/**
 * Checks if the left arrow key is pressed.
 * @param {Event} e - The event object from a key press event.
 * @returns {boolean}
 */
function pressL(e) {
    return e.key === 'ArrowLeft';
}

/**
 * Checks if the right arrow key is pressed.
 * @param {Event} e - The event object from a key press event.
 * @returns {boolean}
 */
function pressR(e) {
    return e.key === 'ArrowRight';
}

// Setting up event listeners for demonstration
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(e) {
    if (pressL(e)) {
        console.log('Left button pressed');
        // Example use, scale cube on left press
        cube.scale.x = sin(t);  // Assuming 't' is defined in your environment as time or a similar variable
    }

    if (pressR(e)) {
        console.log('Right button pressed');
        // Example use, scale cube on right press
        cube.scale.x = saw(t);  // Assuming 't' is defined in your environment as time or a similar variable
    }
});

// Example to mimic interaction with cube's scale (assuming `cube.scale.x` and `t` are managed elsewhere in your application)
var cube = {
    scale: {
        x: 1
    }
};
var t = 0; // `t` could be incremented in an animation loop or similar
```

In this example, the `sin(x)` and `saw(x)` functions are directly based on JavaScript's built-in `Math.sin` and a custom implementation for the sawtooth wave pattern. The predicates `pressL(e)` and `pressR(e)` check for left and right arrow key presses respectively, and the event listener demonstrates their potential use in an interactive environment. Adjustments would be necessary depending on the specific environment and requirements of your application, such as integration into a 3D engine or other UI framework.
