To implement the methods described using JavaScript and assuming a 3D environment (perhaps something like three.js for handling 3D objects), we need to write functions for the mathematical operations and event-driven predicates. Below is an example of how you might code these functions and predicates:

### Functions

```javascript
// Function to return the sine of x
function sin(x) {
    return Math.sin(x);
}

// Function to return the sawtooth wave of x
function saw(x) {
    return x - Math.floor(x);
}
```

### Predicates with event listeners

For the predicates, we need to handle user input, which suggests integrating with event listeners in the environment. We'll assume a simple HTML setup with buttons for the left and right controls. We'll define the predicates based on these buttons being pressed.

```html
<!-- Sample HTML for buttons -->
<button id="leftButton">Left</button>
<button id="rightButton">Right</button>
```

```javascript
// Predicate indicating if the left button is pressed
function pressL(e) {
    return e.target.id === 'leftButton';
}

// Predicate indicating if the right button is pressed
function pressR(e) {
    return e.target.id === 'rightButton';
}

// Adding event listeners to the buttons
document.getElementById('leftButton').addEventListener('click', function(e) {
    if (pressL(e)) {
        console.log('Left button was pressed');
        // Here you might call some function or trigger an action in your system
    }
});

document.getElementById('rightButton').addEventListener('click', function(e) {
    if (pressR(e)) {
        console.log('Right button was pressed');
        // Here you might call some function or trigger an action in your system
    }
});
```

### Integration with 3D system API

Assuming `cube` is a globally accessible object representing your 3D model:

```javascript
// Example function to update the cube's scale on the x-axis based on sine wave
function updateCubeScaleWithSine() {
    cube.scale.x = sin(Date.now() / 1000); // Date.now() / 1000 gives a time-based value for dynamic changes
}

// Example function to update the cube's scale on the x-axis based on sawtooth wave
function updateCubeScaleWithSaw() {
    cube.scale.x = saw(Date.now() / 1000);
}
```

In this setup, the sinusoidal and sawtooth functions create a time-dependent effect on the `cube.scale.x` property, and the event listeners detect button presses, allowing for interactive and dynamic 3D visualizations or operations based on user input. Adjust the time scaling (`Date.now() / 1000`) as needed to fit the visualization's responsiveness and smoothness preferences.
