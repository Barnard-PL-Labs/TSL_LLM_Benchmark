Here is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // It is assumed that the left and right buttons are never pressed at the same time.
  !(pressR(e) && pressL(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // When the right key is pressed, increment the count by 0.1 until the left key is pressed.
  pressR(e) -> ([count <- count + 0.1] W pressL(e));

  // When the left key is pressed, decrement the count by 0.1 until the right key is pressed.
  pressL(e) -> ([count <- count - 0.1] W pressR(e));

  // The rotation of the cube along the y-axis is set to the sine of twice the count value.
  [cube.rotation.y <- sin(2 * count)];

  // The rotation of the polygon along the y-axis follows a sawtooth pattern based on the count.
  [polygon.rotation.y <- saw(0.5 * (1 + count))];

  // The x-position of the cube is fixed at 1.
  [cube.position.x <- 1];

  // The x-position of the polygon is fixed at 3.
  [polygon.position.x <- 3];
}
```

This TSL specification correctly encodes the behavior and conditions described in the natural language specification, including the mutual exclusion of left and right button presses, the continuous updates to count and rotations based on these inputs, and the fixed positions of the graphical elements.
