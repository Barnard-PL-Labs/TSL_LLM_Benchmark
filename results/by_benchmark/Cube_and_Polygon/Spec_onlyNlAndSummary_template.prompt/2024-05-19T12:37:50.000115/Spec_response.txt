```tsl
always assume {
  !(pressR(e) && pressL(e)); // Assumption that the left and right buttons are never pressed at the same time
}

always guarantee {
  pressR(e) -> [count <- count + 0.1] W pressL(e); // When right key is pressed, increment count by 0.1 until the left key is pressed
  pressL(e) -> [count <- count - 0.1] W pressR(e); // When left key is pressed, decrement count by 0.1 until the right key is pressed
  
  // Setting the rotation of the cube based on the sine of twice the count value
  [cube.rotation.y <- sin(2 * count)];
  
  // Setting the rotation of the polygon based on the sawtooth pattern of 0.5 times (1 + count)
  [polygon.rotation.y <- saw(0.5 * (1 + count))];
  
  // Static positions for the cube and polygon
  [cube.position.x <- 1];
  [polygon.position.x <- 3];
}
```
This TSL specification ensures that the graphical interface behaves according to the natural language description, managing the rotation and position of the cube and polygon based on user input while making sure that both inputs are not active simultaneously.
