Hereâ€™s the TSL specification based on your description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // The left and right buttons are never pressed at the same time
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Incrementing the count by 0.1 when the right button is pressed, continuing until the left button is pressed
  pressR(e) -> ([count <- count + 0.1] W pressL(e));
  
  // Decrementing the count by 0.1 when the left button is pressed, continuing until the right button is pressed
  pressL(e) -> ([count <- count - 0.1] W pressR(e));
  
  // The cube's rotation along the y-axis follows the sine of twice the count value
  [cube.rotation.y <- sin(2 * count)];
  
  // The polygon's rotation along the y-axis follows a sawtooth pattern calculated as saw(0.5 * (1 + count))
  [polygon.rotation.y <- saw(0.5 * (1 + count))];
  
  // Setting static positions for cube and polygon
  [cube.position.x <- 1];
  [polygon.position.x <- 3];
}
```

This TSL script encapsulates the assumptions about user input behavior and guarantees detailing how the count value and subsequently the rotations and positions of the graphical objects are managed based on user interactions. The 'count' variable is used to dynamically affect the rotation of the cube and polygon, while their positions are maintained constant.
