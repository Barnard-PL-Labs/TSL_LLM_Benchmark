Here is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Specify that the left and right buttons are never pressed simultaneously
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Increment count by 0.1 when the right key is pressed until the left key is pressed
  pressR(e) -> ([count <- count + 0.1] W pressL(e));

  // Decrement count by 0.1 when the left key is pressed until the right key is pressed
  pressL(e) -> ([count <- count - 0.1] W pressR(e));

  // The rotation of the cube along the y-axis follows the sine of twice the count value
  [cube.rotation.y <- sin(2 * count)];

  // The rotation of the polygon along the y-axis follows a sawtooth function calculated as described
  [polygon.rotation.y <- saw(0.5 * (1 + count))];

  // Set the static position of the cube on the x-axis
  [cube.position.x <- 1];

  // Set the static position of the polygon on the x-axis
  [polygon.position.x <- 3];
}
```

### Explanation
- The `always assume` section ensures the mutual exclusion of the left and right key presses.
- The `always guarantee` section outlines the behavior for incrementing and decrementing the `count` variable based on key presses. The `W` (weak until) operator allows the count modification to continue until the opposite key is pressed.
- The sinusoidal and sawtooth functions for the rotation angles of the cube and polygon are updated continually as the `count` value changes.
- The positions of the cube and polygon are kept constant as specified.
