Here's how the given natural language description can be translated into a TSL (Temporal Stream-based Specification Language) specification:

```tsl
always assume {
  // The left and right buttons are never pressed simultaneously
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // When the right key is pressed, increment the count by 0.1 until the left key is pressed
  pressR(e) -> ([count <- count + 0.1] W pressL(e));

  // When the left key is pressed, decrement the count by 0.1 until the right key is pressed
  pressL(e) -> ([count <- count - 0.1] W pressR(e));

  // The rotation of the cube is set to the sine of twice the count value
  [cube.rotation.y <- sin(2 * count)];

  // The rotation of the polygon follows a sawtooth pattern based on count
  [polygon.rotation.y <- saw(0.5 * (1 + count))];

  // The x-position of the cube is fixed at 1
  [cube.position.x <- 1];

  // The x-position of the polygon is fixed at 3
  [polygon.position.x <- 3];
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Assumptions**:
   - `!(pressL(e) && pressR(e))`: This line ensures mutual exclusion between the left and right key presses, meaning they cannot be pressed at the same time.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - `pressR(e) -> ([count <- count + 0.1] W pressL(e));`: When the right key is pressed, the count increments by 0.1 continuously until the left key is pressed.
   - `pressL(e) -> ([count <- count - 0.1] W pressR(e));`: When the left key is pressed, the count decrements by 0.1 continuously until the right key is pressed.
   - `[cube.rotation.y <- sin(2 * count)];`: The rotation of the cube on the y-axis is continuously set to the sine of twice the current count value.
   - `[polygon.rotation.y <- saw(0.5 * (1 + count))];`: The rotation of the polygon on the y-axis follows a sawtooth pattern calculated from 0.5 times (1 plus the count value).
   - `[cube.position.x <- 1];`: The x-position of the cube is statically set to 1.
   - `[polygon.position.x <- 3];`: The x-position of the polygon is statically set to 3.
