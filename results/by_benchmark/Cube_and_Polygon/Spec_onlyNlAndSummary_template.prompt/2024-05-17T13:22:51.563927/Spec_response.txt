Here is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure that the left and right buttons are never pressed simultaneously
  !(pressR(e) && pressL(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // When the right key is pressed, increment the count by 0.1 until the left key is pressed
  pressR(e) -> ([count <- count + 0.1] W pressL(e));
  
  // When the left key is pressed, decrement the count by 0.1 until the right key is pressed
  pressL(e) -> ([count <- count - 0.1] W pressR(e));
  
  // Continuously update the rotation of the cube along the y-axis to the sine of twice the count value
  [cube.rotation.y <- sin(2 * count)];
  
  // Continuously update the rotation of the polygon along the y-axis to a sawtooth pattern of 0.5 times (1 + count value)
  [polygon.rotation.y <- saw(0.5 * (1 + count))];
  
  // Set the x-position of the cube
  [cube.position.x <- 1];
  
  // Set the x-position of the polygon
  [polygon.position.x <- 3];
}
```

This TSL specification encapsulates the behavior of a UI control system where left and right key inputs adjust a numerical count, influencing the rotational behavior of graphical objects. The cube and polygon have their angular rotations and positions defined to reflect the pressing of these keys while maintaining certain geometric constraints.
