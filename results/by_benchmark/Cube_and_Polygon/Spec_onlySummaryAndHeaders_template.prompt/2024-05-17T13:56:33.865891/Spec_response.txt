always assume {
  // Ensure that the left and right button presses are mutually exclusive
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // If the left button is pressed, the cube's rotation is updated based on a sinusoidal function of the count
  pressL(e) -> [cube.rotation <- sin(count)];

  // If the right button is pressed, the polygon's rotation is updated based on a sawtooth function of the count
  pressR(e) -> [polygon.rotation <- saw(count)];
  
  // Increment count appropriately based on button press
  pressL(e) || pressR(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

  // Maintain static positions for the cube and polygon
  [cube.position <- staticPositionCube];
  [polygon.position <- staticPositionPolygon];

This TSL specification translates the natural language description into a formal structure that manages the graphical interaction based on user input, ensuring that each button press affects the rotation of graphic objects while maintaining their positions fixed.
