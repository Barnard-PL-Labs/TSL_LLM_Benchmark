To translate the given natural language description into a TSL specification, we create `always assume` and `always guarantee` sections that capture the dynamics of user interactions and the effects on the graphical objects' properties. The user inputs from the right and left keys will influence a count that adjusts the angular rotation of a cube and a polygon through sinusoidal and sawtooth functions, respectively. Here's how that can be structured in TSL:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Defines the exclusive relationship between pressing the left and right buttons
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // When the left button is pressed, increment `t` and update the cube's rotation using a sine wave of `t`
  pressL(e) -> {
    [t <- t + 1];
    [cube.rotation <- sin(t)];
  };
  
  // When the right button is pressed, increment `t` and update the polygon's rotation using a sawtooth wave of `t`
  pressR(e) -> {
    [t <- t + 1];
    [polygon.rotation <- saw(t)];
  };
  
  // Set static positions for the cube and polygon to establish a fixed spatial configuration
  [cube.position.x <- 1];
  [cube.position.y <- 1];
  [cube.position.z <- 1];
  
  [polygon.position.x <- 2];
  [polygon.position.y <- 2];
  [polygon.position.z <- 2];
}
```

### Explanation
- **Assumptions**: This part ensures that the left and right buttons cannot be pressed simultaneously, avoiding conflicting input signals.
- **Guarantees**: 
  - When the left button (`pressL(e)`) is pressed, the counter `t` increments by one, and the cube's rotation is updated based on the sine function value of `t`.
  - When the right button (`pressR(e)`) is pressed, similarly, `t` increments by one, and the polygon's rotation is updated based on the sawtooth function value of `t`.
  - The cube and polygon have fixed positions in the graphical space as specified, ensuring they remain statically positioned while their rotations dynamically change according to the input. 

This TSL specification covers user interactions, object transformations, and static positioning as described in the natural language input.
