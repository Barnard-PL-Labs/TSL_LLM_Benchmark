Below is the TSL specification based on your provided description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Mutual exclusion of right and left key presses
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Define initial static positions for cube and polygon
  [cube.position <- 0]; // Static position for the cube
  [polygon.position <- 0]; // Static position for the polygon

  // When the left key is pressed, decrement the count and update the cube's rotation using the sine function
  pressL(e) -> {
    [count <- count - 1];
    [cube.rotation <- sin(count)];
  };

  // When the right key is pressed, increment the count and update the polygon's rotation using the sawtooth function
  pressR(e) -> {
    [count <- count + 1];
    [polygon.rotation <- saw(count)];
  };

  // Ensure graphical objects remain at their defined positions
  [cube.position <- 0];
  [polygon.position <- 0];
}
```

Explanation:
- The `always assume` block enforces that the right and left keys cannot be pressed simultaneously.
- The `always guarantee` block sets static initial positions for the cube and polygon to ensure they remain stationary in terms of position while their rotations are updated based on user inputs.
- Pressing the left key decreases a variable `count`, which influences the cube's rotation via a sinusoidal function.
- Pressing the right key increases the `count`, affecting the polygon's rotation through a sawtooth function. This ensures dynamic visual effects while maintaining fixed positions.
