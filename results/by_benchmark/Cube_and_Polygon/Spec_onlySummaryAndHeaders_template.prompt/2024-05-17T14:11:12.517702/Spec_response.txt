Based on the description provided, you want to translate natural language describing the interaction of user inputs with graphical objects into TSL. Here's how this could be structured:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Assume mutual exclusivity of right and left button presses
  !(pressR(e) && pressL(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // When the right button is pressed, increment the angle count and apply the sinusoidal function to the cube's rotation
  pressR(e) -> [
    angle <- angle + 1,
    cube.rotation <- sin(angle)
  ];

  // When the left button is pressed, increment the angle count and apply the sawtooth function to the polygon's rotation
  pressL(e) -> [
    angle <- angle + 1,
    polygon.rotation <- saw(angle)
  ];
  
  // Define static positions for the cube and the polygon
  // Assuming static positions are meant to be constant or pre-defined, these could be set as constants if not influenced by key presses
  [
    cube.position <- (staticX, staticY, staticZ),
    polygon.position <- (staticX2, staticY2, staticZ2)
  ];
}
```

In this TSL representation:
- Mutual exclusivity of right and left key presses is assumed to prevent simultaneous conflicts.
- The `pressR(e)` and `pressL(e)` predicates trigger updates to a shared `angle` variable, which influences the graphical transformations of a `cube` and `polygon`.
- The rotation adjustments for each object are specified by applying sinusoidal and sawtooth functions to the `angle`.
- Static positions of the cube and polygon are defined, assuming these are fixed and not influenced by user input (this part can be adjusted if interaction is required).

This template should suffice to create a dynamic yet controlled visual representation based on the user's input.
