To create a TSL specification based on the given description, we need to define how user inputs (through the left and right keys) affect a numerical count, which in turn changes the rotation of graphical objects (a cube and a polygon) based on sinusoidal and sawtooth wave functions. We also need to define static positions for these objects. Here's how this could be implemented in TSL:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Define the mutual exclusion between left and right key presses
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Increment the numerical count when the right key is pressed
  pressR(e) -> [count <- count + 1];
  
  // Decrement the numerical count when the left key is pressed
  pressL(e) -> [count <- count - 1];

  // Update the rotation of the cube based on the sine of the current count
  [cube.rotation <- sin(count)];
    
  // Update the rotation of the polygon based on the sawtooth wave of the current count
  [polygon.rotation <- saw(count)];
  
  // Define static positions for the cube and polygon
  [cube.position <- (1, 0, 0)];  // Example position for the cube
  [polygon.position <- (-1, 0, 0)];  // Example position for the polygon
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions:** We use mutual exclusion to ensure that the left and right keys cannot be pressed simultaneously, which simplifies the control logic.

2. **Guarantees:**
   - The `count` variable is incremented or decremented based on the right or left key presses, respectively.
   - The `cube.rotation` is set based on the sine of `count`, providing a continuous sinusoidal rotation as `count` changes.
   - Similarly, the `polygon.rotation` is set based on a sawtooth wave function of `count`, which will give it a repetitive linear rotational pattern.
   - Static positions are defined for both graphical objects to maintain a consistent scene layout. These positions are set as constants but could be adjusted as needed for the scene.

This specification should effectively manage the dynamic rotation and static positioning of the graphical objects based on user input as described.
