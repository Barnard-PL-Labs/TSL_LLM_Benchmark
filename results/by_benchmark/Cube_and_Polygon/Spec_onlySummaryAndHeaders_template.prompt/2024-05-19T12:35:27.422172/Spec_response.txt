Based on the given description and functions, here is a TSL specification that models the behavior of the graphical interface, where user inputs affect the rotation of a cube and a polygon using angular rotations defined by sinusoidal and sawtooth wave functions:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure that the left and right buttons are never pressed simultaneously
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // When the left button is pressed, update the cube's rotation using a sinusoidal function
  pressL(e) -> [cube.rotation <- sin(t)];

  // When the right button is pressed, update the polygon's rotation using a sawtooth wave function
  pressR(e) -> [polygon.rotation <- saw(t)];

  // Define the static positions of the cube and polygon
  [cube.position <- (1, 1, 1)];
  [polygon.position <- (2, 2, 2)];
}
```
In this specification:
- The `always assume` block ensures mutual exclusivity between the left and right button presses to prevent conflicting inputs.
- The `always guarantee` block handles the rotation updates of the cube and the polygon based on the button pressed and assigns their positions statically. Here, `t` would typically represent the time or frame count to make the functions dynamic.
