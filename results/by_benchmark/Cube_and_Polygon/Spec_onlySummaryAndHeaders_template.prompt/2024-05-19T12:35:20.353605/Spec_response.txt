Here is the TSL specification based on the input description for managing a graphical interface involving user interactions and transformations on graphical objects:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Define the exclusive relationship between pressing the right button and the left button
  !(pressR(e) && pressL(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // When the left button is pressed, increment the count and update the cube's rotation using a sine function based on the count
  pressL(e) -> ([count <- count + 1] && [cube.rotation <- sin(count)]);

  // When the right button is pressed, decrement the count and update the polygon's rotation using a sawtooth function based on the count
  pressR(e) -> ([count <- count - 1] && [polygon.rotation <- saw(count)]);

  // Define the static positions for the cube and polygon
  [cube.position <- (1,1,1)];
  [polygon.position <- (2,2,2)];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions**: The specification ensures that the left and right buttons cannot be pressed simultaneously, which is a crucial assumption to handle user inputs neatly and avoid contradictory actions.

2. **Guarantees**:
    - **Count and Rotation Updates**: 
      - When the left button (pressL) is pressed, the `count` variable is incremented and the `rotation` of the `cube` is updated based on the sine of the new `count` value.
      - Conversely, when the right button (pressR) is pressed, the `count` variable is decremented and the `rotation` of the `polygon` is updated using a sawtooth wave function of the new `count` value.
    - **Static Positions**: Both the cube and polygon are assigned static positions in the 3D space to maintain a consistent layout in the graphical interface. The positions `(1,1,1)` for the cube and `(2,2,2)` for the polygon ensure they are placed at fixed locations regardless of user interaction. This helps in establishing a visually dynamic (due to rotations) yet geometrically static scene.
