Below is the TSL specification that captures the described behavior for a graphical interface managing a cube and a polygon based on user inputs:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure the left and right buttons cannot be pressed simultaneously
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // When the right button is pressed, increment the count by 1 and update cube and polygon rotations
  pressR(e) -> [
    count <- count + 1,
    cube.rotation.y <- sin(count),
    polygon.rotation.y <- saw(count)
  ];

  // When the left button is pressed, decrement the count by 1 and update cube and polygon rotations
  pressL(e) -> [
    count <- count - 1,
    cube.rotation.y <- sin(count),
    polygon.rotation.y <- saw(count)
  ];

  // Maintain static positions for the cube and polygon
  [cube.position <- staticPositionCube],
  [polygon.position <- staticPositionPolygon];
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Assumptions**:
   - The specification starts by ensuring mutual exclusion between the left (`pressL(e)`) and right (`pressR(e)`) button presses. This is logical since simultaneous presses would conflict in the context of incrementing and decrementing the count.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - **Count Adjustment**: When the right button is pressed, the count is incremented (`count <- count + 1`), and similarly, it is decremented when the left button is pressed (`count <- count - 1`).
   - **Dynamic Rotation Updates**:
     - The cube's rotation along the y-axis is updated based on the sine of the count, which provides a smooth periodic motion (`cube.rotation.y <- sin(count)`).
     - The polygon's rotation along the y-axis is updated based on the sawtooth function of the count, providing a linear, repeating pattern (`polygon.rotation.y <- saw(count)`).
   - **Static Positions**: The positions of the cube and polygon are set to static values to maintain consistent locations within the scene despite the dynamic rotations.

This TSL specification effectively translates the natural language description into a formal representation that manages the interactive behavior of graphical objects in response to user inputs.
