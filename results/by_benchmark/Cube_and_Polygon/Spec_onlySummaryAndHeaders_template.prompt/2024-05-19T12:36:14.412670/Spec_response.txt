Here is how you could translate the provided natural language description into a TSL specification:

```tsl
always assume {
    // Define the exclusive relationship between pressing the right button and the left button
    !(pressR(e) && pressL(e));
}

always guarantee {
    // When the right key is pressed, increment the count which affects the cube's rotation using a sinusoidal function
    pressR(e) -> [cube.rotation.y <- sin(count)];
    
    // When the left key is pressed, increment the count which affects the polygon's rotation using a sawtooth wave function
    pressL(e) -> [polygon.rotation.y <- saw(count)];
    
    // Static positions for the cube and polygon are maintained
    [cube.position <- staticCubePosition];
    [polygon.position <- staticPolygonPosition];
    
    // Increment the count whenever a key is pressed
    (pressR(e) || pressL(e)) -> [count <- count + 1];
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Assumptions**:
   - Mutual exclusion between left and right key presses is assumed (`!(pressR(e) && pressL(e))`), implying that both keys cannot be pressed simultaneously.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - When the right key is pressed, the cube's `y` rotation is updated based on the sine of a `count` variable (`[cube.rotation.y <- sin(count)]`).
   - When the left key is pressed, the polygon's `y` rotation is updated based on a sawtooth function of the `count` variable (`[polygon.rotation.y <- saw(count)]`).
   - Both the cube and polygon maintain static positions specified by `staticCubePosition` and `staticPolygonPosition`.
   - The `count` variable, which influences the rotation of both graphical objects, is incremented whenever either key is pressed (`(pressR(e) || pressL(e)) -> [count <- count + 1]`).

This specification thus captures the dynamic visual effects triggered by user inputs, maintaining a consistent geometric layout while enabling interactive rotation of objects based on sinusoidal and sawtooth wave functions.
