Here is the TSL specification based on the provided description and functions:

```TSL
always assume {
  // Ensure that the left and right buttons are not pressed simultaneously
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // When the left button is pressed, increment the count for the cube's rotation and update using the sinusoidal function
  pressL(e) -> ([count <- count + 1] && [cube.rotation.y <- sin(count)]);

  // When the right button is pressed, increment the count for the polygon's rotation and update using the sawtooth function
  pressR(e) -> ([count <- count + 1] && [polygon.rotation.y <- saw(count)]);

  // Set initial or static positions of the cube and polygon
  true -> ([cube.position <- (1, 1, 1)] && [polygon.position <- (2, 2, 2)]);
}
```

### Explanation of TSL Specification:
1. **Assumptions**: The specification starts by ensuring mutual exclusion of left and right button presses, which means they cannot be pressed simultaneously.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - **Rotation of Cube**: When the left button is pressed, it increases a counter and applies a sinusoidal function to the cube's rotation around the y-axis.
   - **Rotation of Polygon**: Similarly, pressing the right button increments the same counter but applies a sawtooth function to the polygon's rotation.
   - **Static Positions**: Regardless of the state, the cube and polygon have fixed positions set to predefined coordinates. This means their position in space does not change dynamically, only their rotation does.

This setup creates a dynamic interaction where user inputs adjust the rotations of two objects through different mathematical functions, thereby creating a visually interesting and interactive scene.
