Here is the TSL specification based on the provided functions, predicates, and the natural language description:

```TSL
always assume {
  // Ensure that pressing the left and right buttons are mutually exclusive
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // When the right button is pressed, the cube's rotation is set as sawtooth of the current count
  pressR(e) -> [cube.rotation <- saw(count)];

  // When the left button is pressed, the polygon's rotation is set as sine of the current count
  pressL(e) -> [polygon.rotation <- sin(count)];

  // Increment the count whenever left or right is pressed
  (pressL(e) || pressR(e)) -> [count <- count + 1];

  // Default static positions are set for both objects
  [cube.position <- (1, 0, 0)];
  [polygon.position <- (0, 1, 0)];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Always Assume:**
   - Mutual exclusion between pressing the left and right buttons is defined to ensure that only one input can affect the state at any given time.

2. **Always Guarantee:**
   - Defines actions based on the input:
     - If the right button is pressed, the cube's angular rotation is updated using a sawtooth function of the count.
     - If the left button is pressed, the polygon's angular rotation is updated using a sinusoidal function of the count.
   - Counts are incremented whenever a button is pressed to affect the functions dynamically.
   - Static positions for the cube and the polygon are set, suggesting that while their rotations change, their positions in space remain constant.
