To translate your provided description into a Temporal Stream Logic (TSL) specification, we'll outline the assumptions and guarantees based on the interaction of user inputs (pressing left and right keys) with the rotation of graphical objects using sinusoidal and sawtooth functions. Here is how it can be structured:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure that the left and right buttons are not pressed simultaneously
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // When the left button is pressed, update the cube's rotation using a sinusoidal function of a count
  pressL(e) -> [cube.rotation <- sin(count)];

  // When the right button is pressed, update the polygon's rotation using a sawtooth function of the same count
  pressR(e) -> [polygon.rotation <- saw(count)];

  // Increment the count each time a button is pressed (either left or right)
  (pressL(e) || pressR(e)) -> [count <- count + 1];

  // Maintain the static positions of the cube and polygon
  [cube.position <- staticPositionCube];
  [polygon.position <- staticPositionPolygon];
}
```

### Explanation
- **Assumptions**: The `always assume` block ensures that both the left and right buttons cannot be pressed at the same time. This simplifies the handling of input and avoids conflicting rotations.
  
- **Guarantees**: The `always guarantee` block defines several key behaviors:
  - Rotating the cube using a sinusoidal function (`sin`) when the left button is pressed.
  - Rotating the polygon using a sawtooth function (`saw`) when the right button is pressed.
  - Incrementing a `count` variable each time either button is pressed, which affects the rotation functions.
  - Setting static positions for both the cube and the polygon to ensure they do not move from their initial placements despite their rotations.

This setup ensures a dynamic visual representation on button presses while maintaining the geometric consistency of the scene as described in your natural language specification.
