To deliver a solution based on JavaScript, we can outline the structure for implementing each of the functions and predicates described. These will generally be methods of an object that encapsulates the behavior of the `ship`. Hereâ€™s a basic setup for that:

```javascript
class SpaceShip {
    constructor() {
        this.position = 0; // arbitrary starting position
        this.maxPosition = 100; // assume the rightmost boundary for simplicity
        this.health = 100; // assume starting health
    }

    // Functions
    moveLeft() {
        if (!this.leftmost()) {
            this.position -= 1;
            return 'Moved Left';
        }
        return 'Cannot move left';
    }

    moveRight() {
        if (!this.rightmost()) {
            this.position += 1;
            return 'Moved Right';
        }
        return 'Cannot move right';
    }

    shoot() {
        // Implementation of shooting action
        console.log('Shooting');
    }

    die() {
        // Implementation of what happens when the ship dies
        console.log('Game Over');
        this.health = 0;
    }

    // Predicates
    leftmost() {
        return this.position <= 0; // assuming 0 is the leftmost position
    }

    rightmost() {
        return this.position >= this.maxPosition;
    }

    hit(enemyProjectile) {
        // Assume enemyProjectile is an object with properties that define its position
        if (enemyProjectile.position === this.position) {
            console.log('Ship has been hit!');
            this.health -= enemyProjectile.damage;
            if (this.health <= 0) {
                this.die();
            }
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}

// Usage
let ship = new SpaceShip();
console.log(ship.moveLeft()); // Moves ship to the left
console.log(ship.moveRight()); // Moves ship to the right
ship.shoot(); // Ship shoots
ship.hit({ position: 0, damage: 20 }); // Check if hit by enemy at position 0 with 20 damage

if (ship.leftmost()) {
    console.log('Ship is at the leftmost position');
}

if (ship.rightmost()) {
    console.log('Ship is at the rightmost position');
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Class Structure**: `SpaceShip` class encapsulates all functionalities. The position is initialized to simulate movement within defined boundaries.

2. **Methods**:
   - `moveLeft()` and `moveRight()` adjust the `position` of the ship, checking boundary conditions using `leftmost()` and `rightmost()` predicates.
   - `shoot()` is a simple method to demonstrate shooting action.
   - `die()` simulates the ship's destruction, such as ending the game or losing a life.

3. **Predicates**:
   - `leftmost()` checks if the ship is at the minimum boundary of its movement range.
   - `rightmost()` checks if the ship is at the maximum boundary.
   - `hit()` determines if an enemy projectile has collided with the ship based on positions and reduces health accordingly.

This setup provides a basic framework for a space ship game logic using JavaScript, adhering to the provided API specifications. Adjustments may be necessary depending on the full environment and additional game mechanics.
