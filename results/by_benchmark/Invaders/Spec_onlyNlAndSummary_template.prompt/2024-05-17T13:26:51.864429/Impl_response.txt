Given that you're looking to implement a set of methods in JavaScript using a provided system API, let's consider how these methods might be structured. Since the exact details of the API are not provided, this implementation will assume general behaviors and interactions.

Below is a JavaScript implementation for the described functions and predicates:

```javascript
// Assuming an API object that allows interaction with the ship
const shipAPI = {
    // Mock implementations that interact with the ship
    moveLeft: (ship) => ship.position.x -= 1,
    moveRight: (ship) => ship.position.x += 1,
    shoot: (ship) => console.log("Shooting from", ship.position),
    die: (ship) => console.log("Game Over for ship at", ship.position),
    checkLeftmost: (ship) => ship.position.x === 0,
    checkRightmost: (ship) => ship.position.x === ship.maxX,
    checkHit: (ship) => ship.hitStatus
};

// Functions
function moveLeft(ship) {
    if (!shipAPI.checkLeftmost(ship)) {
        shipAPI.moveLeft(ship);
        return "Moved Left";
    }
    return "Cannot move left";
}

function moveRight(ship) {
    if (!shipAPI.checkRightmost(ship)) {
        shipAPI.moveRight(ship);
        return "Moved Right";
    }
    return "Cannot move right";
}

function shoot(ship) {
    return shipAPI.shoot(ship);
}

function die(ship) {
    return shipAPI.die(ship);
}

// Predicates
function leftmost(ship) {
    return shipAPI.checkLeftmost(ship);
}

function rightmost(ship) {
    return shipAPI.checkRightmost(ship);
}

function hit(ship) {
    return shipAPI.checkHit(ship);
}

// Example usage with a ship object
const ship = {
    position: { x: 5, y: 3 },
    maxX: 10,
    hitStatus: false
};

console.log(moveLeft(ship));  // Moves the ship left
console.log(moveRight(ship)); // Moves the ship right
console.log(shoot(ship));     // Ship shoots
console.log(die(ship));       // Simulate game over

console.log(leftmost(ship));  // Checks if ship is at leftmost position
console.log(rightmost(ship)); // Checks if ship is at rightmost position
console.log(hit(ship));       // Checks if ship has been hit
```

### Notes:
1. **API Assumptions**: The `shipAPI` object contains methods that I assumed would interact with the ship. These might represent a more complex interaction in a real scenario, possibly including asynchronous actions or API calls.
2. **Position and hitStatus**: The `ship` object has attributes for position and hit status. These are simple representations and might be part of a larger object structure in a practical context.
3. **Boundary Conditions**: `leftmost` and `rightmost` are checked before moving the ship left or right. This prevents the ship from moving beyond game boundaries.
4. **Return statements**: Each function provides feedback which can be useful for debugging or user notifications.

This setup provides a basic framework that you can expand upon or integrate into your environment, depending on specific requirements and the details of the system API.
