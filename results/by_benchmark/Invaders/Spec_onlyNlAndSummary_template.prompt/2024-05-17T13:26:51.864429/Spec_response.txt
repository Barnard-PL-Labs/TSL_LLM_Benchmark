Here is the TSL specification based on the natural language description provided:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Mutual Exclusion for Key Inputs:
  !(pressL && pressR);
  !(pressL && pressUp);
  !(pressL && pressDown);
  !(pressR && pressUp);
  !(pressR && pressDown);
  !(pressUp && pressDown);
}

always guarantee {
  // Ship Hit Detection:
  (hitByEnemy || hitByObstacle) -> [dead <- 1];

  // Left Movement:
  pressL -> [positionX <- positionX - 1];

  // Right Movement:
  pressR -> [positionX <- positionX + 1];

  // Shooting Action:
  pressS -> [shootCounter <- shootCounter + 1] || [shootingMechanism <- activate];
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Assumptions**: This section ensures that no two directional keys can be pressed at the same time to avoid conflicting commands regarding movement. It involves a series of mutual exclusions (`!`) between all possible combinations of left (`pressL`), right (`pressR`), up (`pressUp`), and down (`pressDown`) keys.

- **Guarantees**:
  - **Ship Hit Detection**: If the ship is hit by an enemy or obstacle (`hitByEnemy` or `hitByObstacle`), the `dead` flag is set to 1 to indicate hit detection.
  - **Left and Right Movement**: Controls the horizontal movement of the ship. Pressing left (`pressL`) decrements the `positionX` by 1, moving the ship to the left. Pressing right (`pressR`) increments the `positionX` by 1, moving the ship to the right.
  - **Shooting Action**: Triggered by the shoot key (`pressS`). This could increment a counter (`shootCounter`) or activate a shooting mechanism (`shootingMechanism`), depending on how the game is programmed. This representation allows flexibility in how the shooting action is implemented.
