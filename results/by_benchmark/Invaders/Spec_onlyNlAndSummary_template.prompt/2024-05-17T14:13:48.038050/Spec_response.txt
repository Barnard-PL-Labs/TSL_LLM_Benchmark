Here is the TSL specification based on the description provided for the Space Invaders game, focusing on the player's ship behavior with key inputs and interactions:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Mutual exclusion for key inputs to prevent simultaneous directional commands
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
  !(pressL(e) && pressUp(e));
  !(pressL(e) && pressDown(e));
  !(pressR(e) && pressUp(e));
  !(pressR(e) && pressDown(e));
  !(pressUp(e) && pressDown(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Define behavior when the ship is hit by an enemy or obstacle
  shipHit -> [dead <- 1];

  // Behavior for left movement
  pressL(e) -> [shipPosition.x <- shipPosition.x - 1];

  // Behavior for right movement
  pressR(e) -> [shipPosition.x <- shipPosition.x + 1];

  // Behavior for shooting action
  pressS(e) -> [shootCounter <- shootCounter + 1];
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Assumptions**:
  - **Mutual Exclusion for Key Inputs**: Ensures that no two directional keys can be active at the same time, preventing conflicting movements or commands in the game logic.

- **Guarantees**:
  - **Ship Hit Detection**: If the ship is hit (`shipHit`), the `dead` flag is set to `1`, which could be used to trigger game over sequences or indicate the ship has taken damage.
  - **Left Movement**: When the left key is pressed (`pressL(e)`), the ship's `x` position is decreased by one unit, moving it left.
  - **Right Movement**: When the right key is pressed (`pressR(e)`), the ship's `x` position is increased by one unit, moving it right.
  - **Shooting Action**: When the shoot key is pressed (`pressS(e)`), the shooting mechanism is activated, represented by incrementing a shooting counter (`shootCounter`).
  
This TSL specification effectively encapsulates the required behaviors and constraints for the player's ship in the game based on the provided natural language description.
