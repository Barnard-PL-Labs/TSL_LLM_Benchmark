Here is the TSL specification based on the natural language description provided:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Mutual Exclusion for Key Inputs: No two directional keys can be pressed simultaneously
  !(pressL && pressR);
  !(pressL && pressUp);
  !(pressL && pressDown);
  !(pressR && pressUp);
  !(pressR && pressDown);
  !(pressUp && pressDown);
}

always guarantee {
  // Ship Hit Detection: If the ship is hit, set 'dead' flag to 1
  (hitByEnemy || hitByObstacle) -> [dead <- 1];

  // Left Movement: When the left key is pressed, decrement the position by one unit
  pressL -> [position <- position - 1];

  // Right Movement: When the right key is pressed, increment the position by one unit
  pressR -> [position <- position + 1];

  // Shooting Action: When the shoot key is pressed, trigger a shooting mechanism
  pressS -> [shootCounter <- shootCounter + 1];
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Assumptions**: This section ensures that pressing any two directional keys at the same time is not possible. Each condition clearly states that the simultaneous pressing of any combination of the directional keys (left, right, up, down) is forbidden.
  
- **Guarantees**: 
  - The ship hit detection logic sets a `dead` flag to 1 if the ship is hit by an enemy or an obstacle.
  - Movement commands adjust the ship's `position` based on the key pressed (left key decreases the position, right key increases it).
  - The shooting mechanism is activated by increasing a `shootCounter`, which could alternatively be a command to fire a weapon, depending on how the game's mechanics are coded.
