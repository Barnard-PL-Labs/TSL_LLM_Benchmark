The following JavaScript implementation uses a hypothetical API for a game that involves a spaceship. The methods provided handle spaceship movements, shooting, and checking certain states of the spaceship, such as if it's at the boundaries of the game area or if it has been hit by an enemy.

```javascript
// Hypothetical API functions (not provided, assumed for implementation)
// These are placeholders and should be replaced with actual API calls or implemented logic
function apiMoveLeft(ship) {
    // Moves the ship to the left; exact implementation depends on the API
}

function apiMoveRight(ship) {
    // Moves the ship to the right; exact implementation depends on the API
}

function apiShoot(ship) {
    // Causes the ship to shoot; exact implementation depends on the API
}

function apiCheckLeftmost(ship) {
    // Returns true if the ship is at the leftmost boundary; exact implementation depends on the API
    return false; // Placeholder return
}

function apiCheckRightmost(ship) {
    // Returns true if the ship is at the rightmost boundary; exact implementation depends on the API
    return false; // Placeholder return
}

function apiCheckHit(ship) {
    // Returns true if the ship has been hit by an enemy; exact implementation depends on the API
    return false; // Placeholder return
}

function apiDie(ship) {
    // Handles end game or losing life when the ship dies; exact implementation depends on the API
}

// Functions Implementation
function moveLeft(ship) {
    apiMoveLeft(ship);
}

function moveRight(ship) {
    apiMoveRight(ship);
}

function shoot(ship) {
    apiShoot(ship);
}

function die(ship) {
    apiDie(ship);
}

// Predicates Implementation
function leftmost(ship) {
    return apiCheckLeftmost(ship);
}

function rightmost(ship) {
    return apiCheckRightmost(ship);
}

function hit(ship) {
    return apiCheckHit(ship);
}

// Example usage:
let ship = {}; // Assuming 'ship' is an object representing the spaceship
moveLeft(ship); // Move ship left
if (leftmost(ship)) {
    console.log("Ship is at the leftmost position.");
}
if (hit(ship)) {
    console.log("Ship has been hit!");
    die(ship);
}
```

This code assumes that there are underlying API functions like `apiMoveLeft`, `apiMoveRight`, etc., which interact with the game's environment. You will need to replace these placeholder functions with actual implementations provided by the game's API. The example usage at the end demonstrates how these functions and predicates might be used in a game loop or event handler.
