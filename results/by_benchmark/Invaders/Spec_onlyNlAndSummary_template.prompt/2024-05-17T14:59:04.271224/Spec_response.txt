Here's the TSL specification translated from the natural language description provided:

```
always assume {
  // Mutual exclusion for key inputs - ensuring no two directional keys are pressed simultaneously
  ! (pressL && pressR);
  ! (pressL && pressUp);
  ! (pressL && pressDown);
  ! (pressR && pressUp);
  ! (pressR && pressDown);
  ! (pressUp && pressDown);
}

always guarantee {
  // If the ship is hit by an enemy or obstacle, set dead flag to 1
  (hitByEnemy || hitByObstacle) -> [dead <- 1];

  // Movement and actions based on key inputs
  // Left movement
  pressL -> [positionX <- positionX - 1];

  // Right movement
  pressR -> [positionX <- positionX + 1];

  // Shooting action
  pressS -> [shootingCounter <- shootingCounter + 1]; // Assuming shootingCounter tracks shooting actions
}
```

This TSL specification captures the constraints on key inputs for preventing simultaneous directional movements and defines reactions to specific actions like being hit or pressing movement/shooting keys.
