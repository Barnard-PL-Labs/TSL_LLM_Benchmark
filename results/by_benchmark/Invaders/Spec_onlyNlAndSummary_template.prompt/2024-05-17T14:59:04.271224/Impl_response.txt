To implement the specified functions and predicates for a space ship game based on the given API, we will create JavaScript functions to represent each functionality. Note, however, that the full details of the System API aren't provided, so specific API calls (like how to actually move the ship or check if it's at the boundaries) are assumed based on common game development practices. Adjust these to fit the actual API methods and properties available in your environment.

```javascript
// Here are your ship control functions and predicates:

// Functions for controlling the ship
function moveLeft(ship) {
    // Assuming there's a method or property to adjust the ship's position
    if (!leftmost(ship)) {  // Check if not against the leftmost boundary
        ship.position.x -= 1;  // Move the ship left by one unit
        return "Moved Left";
    }
    return "Move Blocked: Leftmost position reached";
}

function moveRight(ship) {
    // Assuming there's a method or property to adjust the ship's position
    if (!rightmost(ship)) {  // Check if not against the rightmost boundary
        ship.position.x += 1;  // Move the ship right by one unit
        return "Moved Right";
    }
    return "Move Blocked: Rightmost position reached";
}

function shoot(ship) {
    // Assuming there's a method to trigger shooting
    ship.shoot();  // Trigger ship's shooting action
    return "Fired Weapon";
}

function die(ship) {
    // Assuming there's a method or property to handle game over or life loss
    ship.gameOver();  // Trigger the end game or life loss
    return "Game Over: Ship has been destroyed";
}

// Predicates for checking ship's state
function leftmost(ship) {
    // Assuming there's a way the ship knows its position or the game world boundaries
    return ship.position.x === 0;  // True if ship is at the leftmost position
}

function rightmost(ship) {
    // Assuming there's a way to know the world width or max allowed x position
    const worldWidth = 10;  // Assuming world width is 10 units
    return ship.position.x >= worldWidth;  // True if ship is at the rightmost position
}

function hit(ship) {
    // Assuming there's a method or property to check if the ship has been hit
    return ship.isHit;  // True if the ship has been hit by an enemy
}
```

### Usage Example:
```javascript
let ship = {
    position: {
        x: 5
    },
    shoot: function() {
        console.log("Shooting from position", this.position.x);
    },
    gameOver: function() {
        console.log("Ship destroyed at position", this.position.x);
    },
    isHit: false
};

console.log(moveLeft(ship));  // Moves ship to the left
console.log(shoot(ship));     // Ship shoots
console.log(hit(ship));       // Checks if the ship has been hit
console.log(die(ship));       // Ends the game if necessary
```

### Notes:
- The above example uses simple JavaScript objects and functions. Adjust `ship` methods (`shoot`, `gameOver`) and properties (`position`, `isHit`) to what's available in your actual game API.
- Constants like `worldWidth` should be adapted to your game's configuration or obtained dynamically if your API allows it.
