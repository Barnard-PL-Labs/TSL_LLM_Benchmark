Based on the given information, I will provide JavaScript implementations for the functions and predicates you listed. However, since you mentioned that the system has an API but did not specify the details, I'll make some assumptions about how the API might allow interaction with the ship's status and define functions accordingly.

### JavaScript Implementations

#### Functions:

```javascript
// Assuming ship is an object that can be manipulated via direct methods or properties
function moveLeft(ship) {
    ship.position -= 1; // Move the ship to the left by one unit
    return 'Moved Left';
}

function moveRight(ship) {
    ship.position += 1; // Move the ship to the right by one unit
    return 'Moved Right';
}

function shoot(ship) {
    // Trigger the ship's shooting mechanism
    ship.shoot();
    return 'Shot fired';
}

function die(ship) {
    // End game or decrement life, depending on game rules
    ship.lives -= 1;
    if (ship.lives <= 0) {
        console.log('Game Over');
    } else {
        console.log('Life lost, continue playing');
    }
    return 'Died';
}
```

#### Predicates:

Predicates will return boolean values based on the ship's status or position. 

```javascript
function leftmost(ship) {
    // Assuming there's a predefined boundary on the left
    return ship.position === 0;
}

function rightmost(ship) {
    // Assuming a predefined maximum position on the right
    const rightBoundary = 100; // Example boundary
    return ship.position === rightBoundary;
}

function hit(ship) {
    // Check if the ship has been hit by an incoming enemy
    // Assuming ship has a 'hit' status that turns true when collision happens
    return ship.hit;
}
```

### Example Usage

```javascript
let ship = {
    position: 50,
    shoot: () => console.log('Pew! Pew!'),
    hit: false,
    lives: 3
};

// Moving the ship left
console.log(moveLeft(ship));

// Checking if the ship is at the leftmost position
console.log('Is ship at leftmost position?', leftmost(ship));

// Ship gets hit
ship.hit = true;
console.log('Has ship been hit?', hit(ship));

// Ship shooting
console.log(shoot(ship));

// Ship dying
console.log(die(ship));
```

#### Notes
1. The `ship` object is a simplified representation and can include more sophisticated mechanisms or properties depending on the actual game.
2. The functions are highly dependent on how the ship's attributes (`position`, `lives`, `hit`) are managed in your actual game environment.
3. Boundary values (like `rightBoundary`) need to be adjusted according to the actual gameplay area dimensions.

This setup provides a basic framework which you can tweak or expand based on your specific system API and game logic requirements.
