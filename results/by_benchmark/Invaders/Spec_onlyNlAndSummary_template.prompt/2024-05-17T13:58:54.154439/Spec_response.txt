Here is how the described behavior can be translated into a Temporal Stream Logic (TSL) specification:

```
always assume {
  //mutual exclusion for all key inputs
  !(pressL && pressR);
  !(pressL && pressUp);
  !(pressL && pressDown);
  !(pressR && pressUp);
  !(pressR && pressDown);
  !(pressUp && pressDown);
}

always guarantee {
  //movement and shooting controls
  pressL -> [ posX <- posX - 1];    // Moves the ship one step to the left
  pressR -> [ posX <- posX + 1];    // Moves the ship one step to the right
  pressS -> [ shoot <- shoot + 1];  // Triggers a shooting action

  //ship hit detection
  (hitByEnemy || hitByObstacle) -> [ dead <- 1 ]; // Sets the dead flag to 1 when hit
}
```

Explanation of TSL components:

1. **Assumptions**:
   - The mutual exclusion of key presses ensures that no conflicting commands (e.g., moving left and right simultaneously) are processed. This is necessary to prevent undefined or erratic behavior in the game.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - **Left and Right Movement**: The ship's horizontal position (`posX`) is adjusted based on whether the left (`pressL`) or right (`pressR`) keys are pressed, with a decrement for left and increment for right.
   - **Shooting Action**: When the shoot key (`pressS`) is pressed, some form of shooting counter or mechanism is activated, represented here by incrementing a `shoot` variable.
   - **Ship Hit Detection**: If the ship is hit by an enemy or an obstacle, the `dead` flag is set to 1. This can be used to trigger a game over sequence or other consequences in the game logic.
