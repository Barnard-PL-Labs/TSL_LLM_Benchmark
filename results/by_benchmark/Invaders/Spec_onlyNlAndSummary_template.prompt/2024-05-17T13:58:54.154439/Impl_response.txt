To implement the described functions and predicates using JavaScript, we need to assume the existence of specific methods or properties within the provided `ship` object. However, since the full API definition for manipulating or obtaining the state of the "ship" has not been provided, we will proceed based on standard practices and logical presumptions.

Here is a basic implementation of the specified functions and predicates:

```javascript
// Functions to manipulate the ship state
function moveLeft(ship) {
    // Assuming ship can decrement its position on x-axis to move left
    if (!leftmost(ship)) {
        ship.position.x -= 1;
    }
    return "Moved Left";
}

function moveRight(ship) {
    // Assuming ship can increment its position on x-axis to move right
    if (!rightmost(ship)) {
        ship.position.x += 1;
    }
    return "Moved Right";
}

function shoot(ship) {
    // Assuming ship shoots a projectile
    console.log("Ship fires a projectile!");
    return "Shoot";
}

function die(ship) {
    // Assuming this function handles end game or loses life
    console.log("Game Over or Life Lost!");
    return "Die";
}

// Predicates to check ship state
function leftmost(ship) {
    // Assuming there is a boundary check for the leftmost position
    return ship.position.x === 0;
}

function rightmost(ship) {
    // Assuming there is a boundary check for the rightmost position
    return ship.position.x === ship.maxX;
}

function hit(ship) {
    // Assuming ship has a status that shows if it has been hit
    return ship.isHit;
}

// Usage example:
const ship = {
    position: { x: 5, y: 10 },
    maxX: 10,
    isHit: false
};

console.log(moveLeft(ship)); // Move the ship left
console.log(ship.position.x); // Output new position for verification

console.log(rightmost(ship)); // Check if ship is at the rightmost position
console.log(hit(ship)); // Check if the ship has been hit
```

### Notes:
1. This implementation assumes `ship` has properties like `position.x`, `maxX` for the maximum x-coordinate boundary, and `isHit` to check if it has been hit.
2. The `moveLeft` and `moveRight` functions check whether the ship is on the boundary before moving it.
3. `leftmost` and `rightmost` functions assume numeric boundaries at `0` and `maxX` respectively.
4. The `shoot` and `die` functions simply log actions as we don't have details on how projectiles are handled or what constitutes game over or life loss in the actual environment.
5. This is a rudimentary implementation, and in a fully-fledged system, you would need to account for more complex behaviors and interactions defined by the system's API.
