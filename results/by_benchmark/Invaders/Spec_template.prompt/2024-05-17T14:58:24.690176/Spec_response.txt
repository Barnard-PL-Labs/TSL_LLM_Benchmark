Here's the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description for controlling a player's spaceship in a game like Space Invaders:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Mutual exclusions for key inputs to ensure no conflicting movements
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
  !(pressL(e) && pressUp(e));
  !(pressL(e) && pressDown(e));
  !(pressR(e) && pressUp(e));
  !(pressR(e) && pressDown(e));
  !(pressUp(e) && pressDown(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Ship movements and interactions
  // If the ship is hit by an enemy, end game or lose a life
  hit(ship) -> [die(ship)];

  // Left movement: if left key is pressed and ship is not at leftmost position
  pressL(e) && !leftmost(ship) -> [ship <- moveLeft(ship)];

  // Right movement: if right key is pressed and ship is not at rightmost position
  pressR(e) && !rightmost(ship) -> [ship <- moveRight(ship)];

  // Shooting action: if shoot key is pressed, trigger shooting
  pressShoot(e) -> [shoot(ship)];
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Assumptions**:
  - The mutual exclusion for key inputs ensures that no two opposing or conflicting directional inputs are processed simultaneously, which could otherwise result in undefined behavior in the game's movement mechanics.

- **Guarantees**:
  - If the ship is hit (`hit(ship)`), the `die(ship)` action is triggered, representing the ship being destroyed or losing a life.
  - When the left key is pressed and the ship is not already at the leftmost boundary (`leftmost(ship)`), the `moveLeft(ship)` function is called to move the ship one unit to the left.
  - When the right key is pressed and the ship is not at the rightmost boundary (`rightmost(ship)`), the `moveRight(ship)` function is called to move the ship one unit to the right.
  - When the shoot key is pressed (`pressShoot(e)`), the `shoot(ship)` function is activated to perform a shooting action, likely engaging the game's firing mechanics to attack enemies.

This specification models simple game controls and interactions, focusing on movement restrictions and basic combat mechanics.
