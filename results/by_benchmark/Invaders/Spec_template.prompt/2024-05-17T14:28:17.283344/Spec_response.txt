Here's the TSL specification based on your description. This specification will cover the behavior of a player's ship in a Space Invaders game, including movement controls, shooting, and handling when the ship gets hit.

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure that no two movements or shooting commands conflict
  !(pressL && pressR);
  !(pressL && pressUp);
  !(pressL && pressDown);
  !(pressR && pressUp);
  !(pressR && pressDown);
  !(pressUp && pressDown);
}

always guarantee {
  // If the left key is pressed and the ship is not at the leftmost position, move left
  (pressL && !leftmost(ship)) -> [ship <- moveLeft(ship)];
  
  // If the right key is pressed and the ship is not at the rightmost position, move right
  (pressR && !rightmost(ship)) -> [ship <- moveRight(ship)];
  
  // When shoot key is pressed, trigger shooting
  pressS -> [ship <- shoot(ship)];
  
  // If the ship gets hit, trigger the end game or lose life
  hit(ship) -> [ship <- die(ship)];
  
  // Ensure that when no movement or shooting keys are pressed, no actions are taken
  !(pressL || pressR || pressS || hit(ship)) -> ([ship <- ship]);
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Mutual Exclusion for Key Inputs:** It's specified that certain key combinations cannot occur simultaneously, ensuring only one action is processed at a time.
2. **Left and Right Movement:** The ship moves left or right if the respective key is pressed, provided it's not already at the boundary of the game space.
3. **Shooting Action:** Activated by pressing a designated shooting key.
4. **Hit Detection:** If the ship is hit, the specified action (like a game over or losing a life) is triggered.
