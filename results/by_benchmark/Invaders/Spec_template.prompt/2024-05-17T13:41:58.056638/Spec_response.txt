Here's how you could translate the given natural language description into a TSL specification for the behavior of a player's ship in a Space Invaders-like game:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Mutual exclusion for key inputs
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
  !(pressL(e) && pressUp(e));
  !(pressL(e) && pressDown(e));
  !(pressR(e) && pressUp(e));
  !(pressR(e) && pressDown(e));
  !(pressUp(e) && pressDown(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Ship movement to the left
  pressL(e) && !leftmost(ship) -> [ship <- moveLeft(ship)] W (pressR(e) || pressUp(e) || pressDown(e));

  // Ship movement to the right
  pressR(e) && !rightmost(ship) -> [ship <- moveRight(ship)] W (pressL(e) || pressUp(e) || pressDown(e));

  // Ship shooting action
  pressShoot(e) -> [ship <- shoot(ship)];

  // Ship hit detection
  hit(ship) -> [ship <- die(ship)];
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Mutual Exclusion for Key Inputs:** The `always assume` block ensures that no two directional keys can be pressed simultaneously, avoiding conflicting commands which would be impossible in a real game.
  
- **Guarantees:**
  - **Left Movement:** When the left key (L) is pressed and the ship is not at the leftmost boundary (`!leftmost(ship)`), the ship moves left. This movement continues until a different movement key is pressed.
  - **Right Movement:** Similar to left movement, but for the right direction, ensuring the ship moves right when the right key (R) is pressed and it is not at the rightmost boundary (`!rightmost(ship)`).
  - **Shooting Action:** When the shoot key (S) is pressed, the ship executes a shoot action.
  - **Ship Hit Detection:** If the ship is hit (`hit(ship)`), it triggers the `die(ship)` function, which could represent losing a life or ending the game.

This specification encapsulates the basic interactions and movements within the game, following the constraints set out in the natural language description.
