Based on the provided natural language description for the game "Space Invaders," here is how the TSL specification could be formulated:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure mutual exclusion among directional inputs to prevent conflicting movements
  !(pressL && pressR);
  !(pressL && pressUp);
  !(pressL && pressDown);
  !(pressR && pressUp);
  !(pressR && pressDown);
  !(pressUp && pressDown);
}

always guarantee {
  // Response to the ship being hit by an enemy or obstacle
  hit(ship) -> [die(ship)];

  // Movement and actions based on key inputs
  // Left movement: move the ship to the left unless it's already at the leftmost position
  (pressL && !leftmost(ship)) -> [moveLeft(ship)];

  // Right movement: move the ship to the right unless it's already at the rightmost position
  (pressR && !rightmost(ship)) -> [moveRight(ship)];

  // Shooting action: trigger a shooting mechanism
  pressS -> [shoot(ship)];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Mutual Exclusion for Key Inputs:** The assumptions section uses logical negations to ensure that no two directional keys can be pressed simultaneously, which is critical to prevent conflicting commands for ship movement.

2. **Ship Hit Detection:** If the ship is hit (`hit(ship)` predicate is true), the `die(ship)` function is invoked, which could represent ending the game or losing a life.

3. **Guarantees:**
   - **Left Movement:** The ship moves left (using `moveLeft(ship)`) only if the left key is pressed and the ship is not at the leftmost boundary (`!leftmost(ship)`).
   - **Right Movement:** Similarly, the ship moves right (using `moveRight(ship)`) only if the right key is pressed and the ship is not at the rightmost boundary (`!rightmost(ship)`).
   - **Shooting Action:** The ship shoots (using `shoot(ship)`) when the shoot key is pressed, which could increment a shooting counter or similar action depending on game mechanics.

This specification effectively captures the key dynamics of the ship's behavior in response to player inputs and interactions with game elements.
