Here's a TSL specification that captures the described behaviors for the player's ship in a "Space Invaders" game scenario:

```tsl
always assume {
  // The ship cannot be at both extremes at the same time
  !(leftmost(ship) && rightmost(ship));

  // The ship cannot be hit and not hit at the same time
  !(!hit(ship) && hit(ship));
}

always guarantee {
  // If the ship is at the leftmost position, it can only move right or shoot
  leftmost(ship) -> (([ship <- moveRight(ship)] || [ship <- shoot(ship)]) W !leftmost(ship));

  // If the ship is at the rightmost position, it can only move left or shoot
  rightmost(ship) -> (([ship <- moveLeft(ship)] || [ship <- shoot(ship)]) W !rightmost(ship));

  // If the ship is not at either boundary, it can move left, move right, or shoot
  !(leftmost(ship) || rightmost(ship)) -> (([ship <- moveLeft(ship)] || [ship <- moveRight(ship)] || [ship <- shoot(ship)]));

  // If the ship is hit by an enemy, the game should perform the die action
  hit(ship) -> [ship <- die(ship)];
}
```

This TSL specification ensures that the ship's movements and actions are correctly constrained by its position and interactions within the game environment, such as being hit or reaching the boundaries of the game area.
