Based on the provided natural language description and the functions and predicates relevant to the "Space Invaders" game, the TSL specification for controlling the player's ship can be described as follows:

```TSL
always assume {
    // The ship can not be both at the leftmost and rightmost positions simultaneously
    !(leftmost(ship) && rightmost(ship));
}

always guarantee {
    // Moving the ship left when it is not at the leftmost boundary
    (!leftmost(ship)) -> [ship <- moveLeft(ship)];

    // Moving the ship right when it is not at the rightmost boundary
    (!rightmost(ship)) -> [ship <- moveRight(ship)];

    // If the ship has been hit, perform the die action
    hit(ship) -> [ship <- die(ship)];

    // The ship shoots
    [ship <- shoot(ship)];
}
```

### Breakdown of Specification:

**Assumptions:**
1. **Mutual Exclusion on Boundaries:** The ship cannot be positioned simultaneously at both the leftmost and rightmost boundaries (`!(leftmost(ship) && rightmost(ship))`). This prevents conflicting actions from being triggered at the same time.

**Guarantees:**
1. **Movement Restrictions:** The ship should only move left if it is not already on the leftmost boundary (`(!leftmost(ship)) -> [ship <- moveLeft(ship)]`), and similarly for the right movement.
2. **Collision Handling:** If the ship gets hit by an enemy, the game should trigger a die action, which might represent losing a life or ending the game (`hit(ship) -> [ship <- die(ship)]`).
3. **Shooting Capability:** Independent of other conditions, the ship can always shoot (`[ship <- shoot(ship)]`). This allows continuous gameplay interaction.

This TSL specification ensures that the ship behaves logically according to the game's rules and player inputs, responding appropriately to boundary conditions and game events like collisions.
