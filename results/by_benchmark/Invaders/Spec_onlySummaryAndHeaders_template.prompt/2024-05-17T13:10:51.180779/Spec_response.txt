Here's the TSL specification capturing the behavior of a player's ship in Space Invaders based on your description:

```tsl
always assume {
    // Ensure that the ship is not at both the leftmost and rightmost positions simultaneously
    !(leftmost(ship) && rightmost(ship));
}

always guarantee {
    // If the ship is hit, the game should signal the end or loss of a life
    hit(ship) -> [die(ship)];
    
    // Ship movement logic based on position constraints
    // When the ship is not at the leftmost position, it can move left
    !leftmost(ship) -> [moveLeft(ship)];
    
    // When the ship is not at the rightmost position, it can move right
    !rightmost(ship) -> [moveRight(ship)];
    
    // The ship has the ability to shoot regardless of position
    [shoot(ship)];
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Assumptions**:
   - The ship cannot simultaneously be at the leftmost and rightmost positions. This is to prevent any logical inconsistency in the game environment.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - If the ship is hit by incoming enemy fire or collision, the ship triggers a `die(ship)` action. This could represent losing a life or ending the game, depending on the game's design.
   - Movement is restricted by the ship's position relative to the game boundaries:
     - The `moveLeft(ship)` action is only guaranteed if the ship is not at the leftmost boundary, preventing it from moving out of the game area.
     - Similarly, `moveRight(ship)` is only allowed when the ship is not at the rightmost boundary.
   - The ship can shoot at any time. This function is included without conditionals to imply that shooting is an action decoupled from movement or being hit.

This TSL specification thus tightly controls the movement actions within boundary conditions and allows for continuous interaction with the game environment via shooting, all the while handling the game-over scenario through the `hit(ship)` predicate.
