Here is the TSL specification based on your description for the player's ship behavior in Space Invaders:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Assume that at any given time, the ship can either not be hit, or can be hit by an incoming enemy.
  (hit(ship) || !hit(ship));
  // Assume that the ship is either at the leftmost or rightmost boundary, or it is not.
  (leftmost(ship) || !leftmost(ship));
  (rightmost(ship) || !rightmost(ship));
}

always guarantee {
  // If the ship is hit by an enemy, the game should execute the die action.
  hit(ship) -> [ship <- die(ship)];

  // If the ship is at the leftmost position, it should only be able to move right or shoot.
  leftmost(ship) -> (!([ship <- moveLeft(ship)]) && ([ship <- moveRight(ship)] || [ship <- shoot(ship)]));

  // If the ship is at the rightmost position, it should only be able to move left or shoot.
  rightmost(ship) -> (!([ship <- moveRight(ship)]) && ([ship <- moveLeft(ship)] || [ship <- shoot(ship)]));

  // If the ship is not at any boundary, it can move left, move right, or shoot.
  (!leftmost(ship) && !rightmost(ship)) -> ([ship <- moveLeft(ship)] || [ship <- moveRight(ship)] || [ship <- shoot(ship)]);
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions**:
   - The first assumption ensures the ship can either be hit or not be hit at any given time.
   - The second and third assumptions deal with the ship being at the boundaries (leftmost or rightmost).

2. **Guarantees**:
   - If the ship is hit (`hit(ship)`), it triggers the `die` function which could end the game or cause the player to lose a life.
   - When the ship is at the leftmost boundary (`leftmost(ship)`), it cannot move left further, thus only `moveRight` or `shoot` actions are allowed.
   - When the ship is at the rightmost boundary (`rightmost(ship)`), it cannot move right further, so it can only move left or shoot.
   - If the ship is not at any boundary, it can move freely to the left or right and can also shoot.

This specification ensures that the ship's movement and actions are correctly restricted based on its position and the game events.
