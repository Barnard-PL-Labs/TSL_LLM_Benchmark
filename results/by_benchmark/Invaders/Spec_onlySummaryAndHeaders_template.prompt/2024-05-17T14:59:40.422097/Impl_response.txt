To implement the specified functions and predicates in JavaScript for the given environment, you would first need to understand the capabilities of the `ship` object provided by the API. However, since detailed information on the API's properties and methods is not directly provided here, I'll create a basic structure using typical JavaScript functions combined with assumed properties or methods.

Given the requirements, here's how you could implement the JavaScript functions and predicates for the "Cells" system managing the ship:

```javascript
// Functions
function moveLeft(ship) {
    // Assuming ship has a method to modify its horizontal position
    if (!leftmost(ship)) { // Check if not at the leftmost position
        ship.position.x -= 1; // Move left by one unit
    }
    return "Moved Left";
}

function moveRight(ship) {
    // Assuming ship has a method to modify its horizontal position
    if (!rightmost(ship)) { // Check if not at the rightmost position
        ship.position.x += 1; // Move right by one unit
    }
    return "Moved Right";
}

function shoot(ship) {
    // Assuming ship can trigger its shooting mechanism
    return "Shoot";
}

function die(ship) {
    // Assuming this function ends the game or reduces life
    console.log("Game Over or Life Lost");
}

// Predicates
function leftmost(ship) {
    // Assuming there is a known left boundary, perhaps at position x=0
    return ship.position.x === 0;
}

function rightmost(ship) {
    // Assuming there is a known right boundary, perhaps at position x=width-1 where width is the width of the playable area.
    return ship.position.x === ship.boundary.right;
}

function hit(ship) {
    // Assuming ship has a property 'hitStatus' that is true if hit
    return ship.hitStatus === true;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Functions (`moveLeft`, `moveRight`, `shoot`, `die`)**:
   - For movement functions (`moveLeft` and `moveRight`), it's assumed that the `ship` object has a `position` object with an `x` property that can be incremented or decremented to move the ship.
   - The `shoot` function returns a simple string to indicate shooting; ideally, it would trigger a mechanism in `ship` to fire a weapon.
   - The `die` function is a placeholder for handling game termination or life decrement scenarios.

2. **Predicates (`leftmost`, `rightmost`, `hit`)**:
   - The `leftmost` and `rightmost` functions check if the ship is at the boundary of the playing area, assuming the `ship` object has access to its position and boundary.
   - The `hit` function checks a hypothetical `hitStatus` property, which should be managed by the game engine to reflect when the ship takes damage.

In real scenarios, these functions and properties should be precisely defined by the system's API documentation. Without this documentation, assumptions are necessary for the implementation. The systemâ€™s actual capabilities might allow for more efficient or different implementations.
