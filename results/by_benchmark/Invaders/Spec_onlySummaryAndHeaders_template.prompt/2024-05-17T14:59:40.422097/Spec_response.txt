```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure mutual exclusion for ship's position predicates
  !(leftmost(ship) && rightmost(ship));
  // Ensure mutual exclusion for simultaneously moving left and right
  !([ship <- moveLeft(ship)] && [ship <- moveRight(ship)]);
  // Define the logic when the ship is hit
  hit(ship) -> [ship <- die(ship)];
}

always guarantee {
  // Define left movement, ensuring the ship does not move further left if it's already at the leftmost position
  !leftmost(ship) -> [ship <- moveLeft(ship)];
  
  // Define right movement, ensuring the ship does not move further right if it's already at the rightmost position
  !rightmost(ship) -> [ship <- moveRight(ship)];

  // Action to shoot
  [ship <- shoot(ship)];
}
```

This TSL specification considers the behavior of a player's ship in Space Invaders. It includes assumptions about the exclusivity of ship's position and movement directions, and guarantees for handling movement and shooting, while also addressing the situation when the ship is hit.
