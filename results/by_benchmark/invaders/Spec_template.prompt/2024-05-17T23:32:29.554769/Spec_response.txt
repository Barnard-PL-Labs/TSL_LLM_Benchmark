Here is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Mutual exclusion for key inputs to prevent simultaneous conflicting movements
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
  !(pressL(e) && pressUp(e));
  !(pressL(e) && pressDown(e));
  !(pressR(e) && pressUp(e));
  !(pressR(e) && pressDown(e));
  !(pressUp(e) && pressDown(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // If the ship is hit by an enemy or an obstacle, set a specific condition or flag
  hit(ship) -> [command <- die(ship)];

  // Movement guarantees based on key presses
  pressL(e) && !leftmost(ship) -> [command <- moveLeft(ship)];
  pressR(e) && !rightmost(ship) -> [command <- moveRight(ship)];

  // Shooting action when the shoot key is pressed
  pressS(e) -> [command <- shoot(ship)];
}
```

This TSL specification defines the behavior of the player's ship in a way that:
- Ensures that no two directional keys can be pressed at the same time, avoiding conflict in commands.
- Responds to the ship being hit by setting a flag or performing an action that could signal game over or reduce life.
- Moves the ship left or right when the corresponding key is pressed, unless the ship is already at the boundary of the game space (leftmost or rightmost).
- Triggers a shooting action when the shoot key is pressed.
