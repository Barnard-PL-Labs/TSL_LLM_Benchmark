Here is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description and given function and predicate list:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Mutual Exclusion for Key Inputs
  ! (pressL(ship) && pressR(ship));
  ! (pressL(ship) && pressUp(ship));
  ! (pressL(ship) && pressDown(ship));
  ! (pressR(ship) && pressUp(ship));
  ! (pressR(ship) && pressDown(ship));
  ! (pressUp(ship) && pressDown(ship));
}

always guarantee {
  // Ship Hit Detection
  hit(ship) -> [die(ship)];
  
  // Left Movement
  pressL(ship) && !leftmost(ship) -> [moveLeft(ship)];
  
  // Right Movement
  pressR(ship) && !rightmost(ship) -> [moveRight(ship)];
  
  // Shooting Action
  pressS(ship) -> [shoot(ship)];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions**:
   - **Mutual Exclusion for Key Inputs**: Ensures that no two directional keys can be pressed simultaneously to prevent conflicting movements.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - **Ship Hit Detection**: If the ship is hit (`hit(ship)`), the die function is triggered (`[die(ship)]`), which could end the game or cause the ship to lose a life.
   - **Left Movement**: When the left key is pressed (`pressL(ship)`) and the ship is not at the leftmost position (`!leftmost(ship)`), the ship moves left (`[moveLeft(ship)]`).
   - **Right Movement**: Similarly, when the right key is pressed (`pressR(ship)`) and the ship is not at the rightmost position (`!rightmost(ship)`), the ship moves right (`[moveRight(ship)]`).
   - **Shooting Action**: Activates the shooting mechanism when the shoot key is pressed (`pressS(ship)`).

This TSL specification ensures that the game's inputs are handled correctly and that the ship's responses are accurately modeled as per the behaviors expected in a game like Space Invaders.
