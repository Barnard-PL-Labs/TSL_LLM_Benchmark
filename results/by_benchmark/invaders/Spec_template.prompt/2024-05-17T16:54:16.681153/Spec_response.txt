always guarantee {
  // Handling the left movement
  pressL(ship) -> [ ship.position.x <- moveLeft(ship) ];
  
  // Handling the right movement
  pressR(ship) -> [ ship.position.x <- moveRight(ship) ];

}
```

This TSL specification captures the rules for a space ship in a game environment, handling key controls for movement and actions, ensuring that no conflicting controls are processed at the same time, and managing the ship's response to collisions.
