To implement the described functions and predicates for the spaceship interactive system, we can define JavaScript functions using the provided specifications. I'll assume the `ship` object has properties and methods that allow it to interact with the game environment, such as its position. Here's how you could write these functions and predicates in JavaScript:

### Functions

```javascript
// Function to move the ship to the left by one unit
function moveLeft(ship) {
  if (!leftmost(ship)) {
    ship.position.x -= 1;  // Adjust this according to how your coordinate system is defined
    return "Moved left";
  }
  return "Cannot move left";
}

// Function to move the ship to the right by one unit
function moveRight(ship) {
  if (!rightmost(ship)) {
    ship.position.x += 1;  // Adjust this according to how your coordinate system is defined
    return "Moved right";
  }
  return "Cannot move right";
}

// Function to make the ship shoot
function shoot(ship) {
  // Assuming ship has a method to initiate shooting
  ship.fire();
  return "Shot fired";
}

// Function to handle the ship's destruction or death
function die(ship) {
  // Assuming there's a method to handle game over or life reduction
  ship.endGame();
  return "Game over";
}
```

### Predicates

```javascript
// Predicate to check if the ship is at the leftmost position
function leftmost(ship) {
  // Assuming there's a known minimum x-coordinate that defines the leftmost boundary
  const LEFT_BOUNDARY = 0;  // Adjust according to your coordinate system
  return ship.position.x <= LEFT_BOUNDARY;
}

// Predicate to check if the ship is at the rightmost position
function rightmost(ship) {
  // Assuming there's a known maximum x-coordinate that defines the rightmost boundary
  const RIGHT_BOUNDARY = 100;  // Adjust according to your coordinate system
  return ship.position.x >= RIGHT_BOUNDARY;
}

// Predicate to check if the ship has been hit by an enemy
function hit(ship) {
  // Assuming ship has a status property that reflects its hit state
  return ship.isHit;
}
```

### Notes:
1. Adjust the position manipulation (`ship.position.x += 1` or `- 1`) based on how your game's coordinate system is structured.
2. The constants `LEFT_BOUNDARY` and `RIGHT_BOUNDARY` should be set according to the game's display area dimensions.
3. These functions assume that the `ship` object has methods or properties such as `position`, `fire()`, and `endGame()`, which need to be correctly defined in your game engine.
4. Error handling and more complex game logic (like collision detection, game state management) need to be integrated separately depending on your game's architecture and requirements.

This setup creates a basic interactive model for spaceship controls within a game environment using JavaScript, implementing movement, shooting, and status checks.
