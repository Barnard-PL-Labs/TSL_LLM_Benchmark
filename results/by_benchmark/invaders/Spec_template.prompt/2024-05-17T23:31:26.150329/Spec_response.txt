Here is a TSL specification based on the provided natural language description to model the behavior of a player's ship in a game like Space Invaders:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Mutual Exclusion for Key Inputs
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
  !(pressL(e) && pressUp(e));
  !(pressL(e) && pressDown(e));
  !(pressR(e) && pressUp(e));
  !(pressR(e) && pressDown(e));
  !(pressUp(e) && pressDown(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Ship Hit Detection
  hit(ship) -> [die(ship)];

  // Left Movement
  pressL(e) -> ([ship <- moveLeft(ship)] W (pressR(e) || rightmost(ship)));

  // Right Movement
  pressR(e) -> ([ship <- moveRight(ship)] W (pressL(e) || leftmost(ship)));

  // Shooting Action
  pressS(e) -> [ship <- shoot(ship)];
}
```

### Explanation:
**Assumptions:** 
- Mutual exclusions ensure that no two directional keys can be pressed simultaneously, preventing conflicting movements.

**Guarantees:**
- `hit(ship) -> [die(ship)]`: If the ship is hit, the action to end the game or lose a life is triggered.
- `pressL(e) -> ([ship <- moveLeft(ship)] W (pressR(e) || rightmost(ship)))`: When the left key is pressed, the ship moves to the left until either the right key is pressed or it reaches the rightmost limit.
- `pressR(e) -> ([ship <- moveRight(ship)] W (pressL(e) || leftmost(ship)))`: When the right key is pressed, the ship moves to the right until either the left key is pressed or it reaches the leftmost limit.
- `pressS(e) -> [ship <- shoot(ship)]`: When the shoot key is pressed, the ship performs a shooting action. 

This TSL specification accurately models the behavior of a ship based on key inputs and collisions in a space-themed arcade game.
