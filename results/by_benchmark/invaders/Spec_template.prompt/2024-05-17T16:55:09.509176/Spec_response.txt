Here is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description of the game logic for a player's ship in Space Invaders:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Mutual exclusion for key inputs to prevent simultaneous conflicting movements
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
  !(pressL(e) && pressUp(e));
  !(pressL(e) && pressDown(e));
  !(pressR(e) && pressUp(e));
  !(pressR(e) && pressDown(e));
  !(pressUp(e) && pressDown(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Handling ship movement to the left
  pressL(e) -> {
    !leftmost(ship) -> [ship <- moveLeft(ship)];
  };

  // Handling ship movement to the right
  pressR(e) -> {
    !rightmost(ship) -> [ship <- moveRight(ship)];
  };

  // Handling shooting action
  pressS(e) -> [ship <- shoot(ship)];

  // Handling ship being hit by an enemy or obstacle
  hit(ship) -> [ship <- die(ship)];
}
```

### Details of the TSL Specification:
- **Mutual Exclusion**:
  - The `always assume` block ensures no two directional keys can be pressed at the same time, avoiding potential conflicts in commands which could result in undefined behavior.

- **Movement Logic**:
  - For leftward movement (`pressL(e)`), the ship moves left unless it is at the leftmost boundary (`leftmost(ship)`).
  - For rightward movement (`pressR(e)`), the ship moves right unless it is at the rightmost boundary (`rightmost(ship)`).

- **Shooting Mechanism**:
  - Activated by pressing the shoot key (`pressS(e)`), resulting in the ship executing the `shoot(ship)` function.

- **Hit Detection and Response**:
  - If the ship is hit (`hit(ship)`), the `die(ship)` function is triggered, which could indicate losing a life or ending the game, depending on game design.

This specification captures the essential logic to control the player's ship in response to user inputs and game events.
