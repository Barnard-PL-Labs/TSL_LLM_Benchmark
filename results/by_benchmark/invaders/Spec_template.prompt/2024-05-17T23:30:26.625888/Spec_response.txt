Here is the TSL specification based on your description for the behavior of a player's ship in a game like Space Invaders:

```tsl
always assume {
    // Mutual Exclusion for Key Inputs
    ! (pressL(e) && pressR(e));
    ! (pressL(e) && pressUp(e));
    ! (pressL(e) && pressDown(e));
    ! (pressR(e) && pressUp(e));
    ! (pressR(e) && pressDown(e));
    ! (pressUp(e) && pressDown(e));
}

always guarantee {
    // Ship Hit Detection
    hit(ship) -> [command <- die(ship)];

    // Left Movement
    (pressL(e) && !leftmost(ship)) -> [ship <- moveLeft(ship)];

    // Right Movement
    (pressR(e) && !rightmost(ship)) -> [ship <- moveRight(ship)];

    // Shooting Action
    pressS(e) -> [ship <- shoot(ship)];
}
```
Explanation:
1. **Mutual Exclusion for Key Inputs**: The logical expressions ensure that no two directional or action keys are pressed at the same time, thus avoiding conflicting commands.
2. **Ship Hit Detection**: If the ship is hit, as indicated by the predicate `hit(ship)`, the ship will execute the `die(ship)` function possibly leading to a game over or loss of life.
3. **Left and Right Movement**: When the left (`pressL(e)`) or right (`pressR(e)`) key is pressed, and the ship is not at the respective boundary (`leftmost(ship)` or `rightmost(ship)`), the ship moves in the corresponding direction.
4. **Shooting Action**: When the shoot key (`pressS(e)`) is pressed, it triggers the `shoot(ship)` function to simulate firing a projectile or weapon in the game.

This TSL specification adheres to the constraints and behaviors outlined in your natural language description, ensuring functional correctness in the game context.
