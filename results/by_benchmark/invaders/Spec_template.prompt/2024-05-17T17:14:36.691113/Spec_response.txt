This TSL specification covers the behavior of a spaceship in a game setting, responding to user inputs and in-game events like collisions. The `always assume` block handles input constraints, ensuring that no conflicting directional commands are given simultaneously. The `always guarantee` block defines the game mechanics involving ship movement, shooting, and the response to being hit.
