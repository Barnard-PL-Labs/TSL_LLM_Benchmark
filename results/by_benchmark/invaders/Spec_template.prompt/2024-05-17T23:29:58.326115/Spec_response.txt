Here's the corresponding TSL specification based on the provided description for the behavior of a player's ship in a game like Space Invaders:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Mutual exclusion for key inputs to prevent conflicting movements
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
  !(pressL(e) && pressUp(e));
  !(pressL(e) && pressDown(e));
  !(pressR(e) && pressUp(e));
  !(pressR(e) && pressDown(e));
  !(pressUp(e) && pressDown(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Ship movement and action handling
  // Left movement: if the left key is pressed and the ship is not already at the leftmost position
  pressL(e) && !leftmost(ship) -> [moveLeft(ship)];
  
  // Right movement: if the right key is pressed and the ship is not already at the rightmost position
  pressR(e) && !rightmost(ship) -> [moveRight(ship)];
  
  // Shooting action: if the shoot key is pressed
  pressShoot(e) -> [shoot(ship)];
  
  // Ship hit detection: if the ship has been hit
  hit(ship) -> [die(ship)];
}
```

### Explanation
- **Assumptions** set strict rules about the keys that can be pressed. Here, mutual exclusion ensures that no two directional or conflicting keys can be activated simultaneously.
- **Guarantees** define how the system responds to various key presses and game events:
  - When the left or right key is pressed, the ship moves in the corresponding direction unless it's already at the boundary (leftmost or rightmost).
  - When the shoot key is pressed, the shooting action is triggered.
  - If the ship is hit by an enemy or obstacle, the appropriate action is taken (e.g., triggering a game over or losing a life).
