Here is the TSL specification that models the behavior of a player's ship in a game similar to Space Invaders based on the provided description and function predicates:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Mutual Exclusion for Key Inputs
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
  !(pressL(e) && pressUp(e));
  !(pressL(e) && pressDown(e));
  !(pressR(e) && pressUp(e));
  !(pressR(e) && pressDown(e));
  !(pressUp(e) && pressDown(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Ship Hit Detection
  hit(ship) -> [die(ship)];

  // Left Movement
  pressL(e) && !leftmost(ship) -> [moveLeft(ship)];
  
  // Right Movement
  pressR(e) && !rightmost(ship) -> [moveRight(ship)];
  
  // Shooting Action
  pressS(e) -> [shoot(ship)];
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Assumptions**: 
   - The `always assume` block defines mutual exclusions for key inputs to ensure no two directional keys are pressed simultaneously. This prevents conflicting movements which are critical in a game setting for precise control.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - **Ship Hit Detection**: When the ship is hit (`hit(ship)` predicate), the `die(ship)` function is executed, which could end the game or reduce a life, depending on game mechanics.
   - **Left Movement**: If the left key is pressed (`pressL(e)`) and the ship is not already at the leftmost boundary (`!leftmost(ship)`), the ship moves left by one unit (`moveLeft(ship)`).
   - **Right Movement**: Similarly, if the right key is pressed (`pressR(e)`) and the ship is not at the rightmost edge (`!rightmost(ship)`), the ship moves right (`moveRight(ship)`).
   - **Shooting Action**: Pressing the shoot key (`pressS(e)`) triggers the shooting mechanism (`shoot(ship)`).

This TSL specification clearly dictates the responsive actions of the ship based on the game's control inputs and environmental conditions, enhancing the game's interactivity and playability while maintaining clear and non-conflicting commands.
