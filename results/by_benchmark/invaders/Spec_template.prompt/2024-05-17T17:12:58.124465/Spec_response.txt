Here is the TSL specification for the behavior you described:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Mutual exclusion for key inputs
  !(pressL && pressR);
  !(pressL && pressUp);
  !(pressL && pressDown);
  !(pressR && pressUp);
  !(pressR && pressDown);
  !(pressUp && pressDown);
}

always guarantee {
  // Ship hit detection
  hit(ship) -> [die(ship)];
  
  // Left Movement
  pressL -> (leftmost(ship) -> [ship <- ship]; !leftmost(ship) -> [moveLeft(ship)]);
  
  // Right Movement
  pressR -> (rightmost(ship) -> [ship <- ship]; !rightmost(ship) -> [moveRight(ship)]);
  
  // Shooting Action
  pressS -> [shoot(ship)];
}
```

### Explanation:

**Assumptions:**
1. **Mutual Exclusion for Key Inputs**: The ship cannot receive contradictory directional inputs at the same time, such as pressing left and right simultaneously. This ensures that the game's input logic is straightforward and manageable.

**Guarantees:**
1. **Ship Hit Detection**: If the ship is hit, it triggers the `die(ship)` function, which could end the game or result in the ship losing a life.
2. **Left Movement**: If the left key is pressed and the ship is not at the leftmost boundary (`leftmost(ship)`), the ship will move left (`moveLeft(ship)`). If the ship is at the leftmost boundary, it doesn't move.
3. **Right Movement**: Similar to left movement, but for the right direction. If the right key is pressed and the ship is not at the rightmost boundary (`rightmost(ship)`), the ship will move right (`moveRight(ship)`). If it is at the boundary, no movement occurs.
4. **Shooting Action**: When the shoot key (`pressS`) is pressed, it triggers the `shoot(ship)` function to perform a shooting action.

This specification models the basic reactive behavior for a playerâ€™s ship in a space shooter game, responding to user input and in-game events.
