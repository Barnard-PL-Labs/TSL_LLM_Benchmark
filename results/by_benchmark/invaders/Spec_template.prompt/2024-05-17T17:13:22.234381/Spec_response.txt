Here is the TSL specification based on the natural language description provided for the behavior of a player's ship in Space Invaders:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Mutual Exclusion for Key Inputs
  !(pressL && pressR);
  !(pressL && pressUp);
  !(pressL && pressDown);
  !(pressR && pressUp);
  !(pressR && pressDown);
  !(pressUp && pressDown);
}

always guarantee {
  // Left Movement
  (pressL && !leftmost(ship)) -> [ship <- moveLeft(ship)];

  // Right Movement
  (pressR && !rightmost(ship)) -> [ship <- moveRight(ship)];

  // Shooting Action
  pressShoot -> [ship <- shoot(ship)];

  // Ship Hit Detection
  hit(ship) -> [ship <- die(ship)];
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Assumptions**:
   - The mutual exclusion conditions for key inputs ensure that no two conflicting directional or action keys are pressed at the same time. This prevents the system from processing contradictory commands.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - **Left Movement**: If the left key is pressed and the ship is not at the leftmost position, the ship moves left.
   - **Right Movement**: If the right key is pressed and the ship is not at the rightmost position, the ship moves right.
   - **Shooting Action**: If the shoot key is pressed, it triggers the shooting action.
   - **Ship Hit Detection**: If the ship is hit by an enemy or obstacle, the game processes this event, potentially triggering an end game or life loss scenario.

This specification maps the key inputs directly to actions, respecting the constraints of the game environment, such as boundary conditions and hit detection.
