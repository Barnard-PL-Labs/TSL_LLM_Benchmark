```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure that no two directional or action keys can be pressed simultaneously
  !(pressL && pressR);
  !(pressL && pressUp);
  !(pressL && pressDown);
  !(pressR && pressUp);
  !(pressR && pressDown);
  !(pressUp && pressDown);
}

always guarantee {
  // Define the behavior when the left key is pressed
  pressL -> (
    leftmost(ship) // Check if the ship is already at the leftmost boundary
      ? [command <- idle] // Do nothing if it's at the leftmost boundary
      : [command <- moveLeft(ship)] // Move the ship left otherwise
  );

  // Define the behavior when the right key is pressed
  pressR -> (
    rightmost(ship) // Check if the ship is already at the rightmost boundary
      ? [command <- idle] // Do nothing if it's at the rightmost boundary
      : [command <- moveRight(ship)] // Move the ship right otherwise
  );

  // Define the behavior when the shoot key is pressed
  pressS -> [command <- shoot(ship)]; // Trigger the shooting action

  // Define the behavior when the ship is hit
  hit(ship) -> [command <- die(ship)]; // Trigger the end game or lose life condition
}
```

This TSL specification includes mutual exclusion for key inputs to ensure that no conflicting movements or actions are processed simultaneously. Additionally, it outlines the specific responses when the ship is hit or when different keys are pressed, handling movement constraints at the boundaries of the game's space, as well as shooting and damage actions.
