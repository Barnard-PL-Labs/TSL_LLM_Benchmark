Here is a TSL specification based on the provided natural language description, modeling the behavior of a player's spaceship in the game Space Invaders:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Mutual exclusion for key inputs to prevent conflicting movements
  ! (pressL && pressR);
  ! (pressL && pressUp);
  ! (pressL && pressDown);
  ! (pressR && pressUp);
  ! (pressR && pressDown);
  ! (pressUp && pressDown);
}

always guarantee {
  // Handling ship hit detection
  hit(ship) -> [die(ship)];

  // Left movement
  pressL -> {
    !leftmost(ship) -> [moveLeft(ship)];
  };

  // Right movement
  pressR -> {
    !rightmost(ship) -> [moveRight(ship)];
  };

  // Shooting action
  pressS -> [shoot(ship)];
}
```

### Breakdown of the TSL Specification:

1. **Assumptions Section**:
   - **Mutual Exclusion for Key Inputs**: Ensures that no two directional keys can be pressed simultaneously, which prevents conflicting commands for moving the spaceship. This is crucial because simultaneous contrary movements (like left and right) should not be possible.

2. **Guarantees Section**:
   - **Ship Hit Detection**: If the ship is hit (`hit(ship)`), the game reacts by triggering a die action (`die(ship)`), which can be programmed to end the game or reduce the player's life.
   - **Left Movement**: If the left key is pressed (`pressL`), the spaceship will move left (`moveLeft(ship)`) unless it is already at the leftmost position (`!leftmost(ship)`).
   - **Right Movement**: Similarly, if the right key is pressed (`pressR`), the ship moves right (`moveRight(ship)`) unless it is at the rightmost boundary (`!rightmost(ship)`).
   - **Shooting Action**: Pressing the shoot key (`pressS`) triggers a shooting action (`shoot(ship)`), which can be visualized as firing a projectile.

This TSL specification aligns with the game's need to process single directional inputs while providing mechanisms for shooting and handling collisions with enemies or obstacles, following the rules and logic typical in Space Invaders or similar arcade games.
