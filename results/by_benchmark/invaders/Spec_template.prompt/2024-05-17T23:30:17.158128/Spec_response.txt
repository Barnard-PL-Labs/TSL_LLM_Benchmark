Here's how you could translate the described behaviors into a TSL specification for the Space Invaders game scenario:

```tsl
always assume {
    // Ensuring that no two directional keys can be pressed simultaneously
    !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
    !(pressL(e) && pressUp(e));
    !(pressL(e) && pressDown(e));
    !(pressR(e) && pressUp(e));
    !(pressR(e) && pressDown(e));
    !(pressUp(e) && pressDown(e));
}

always guarantee {
    // Response when the ship is hit by an enemy or an obstacle
    hit(ship) -> [command <- die(ship)];

    // Managing left movement - move the ship left unless it is at the leftmost boundary
    pressL(e) && !leftmost(ship) -> [command <- moveLeft(ship)];

    // Managing right movement - move the ship right unless it is at the rightmost boundary
    pressR(e) && !rightmost(ship) -> [command <- moveRight(ship)];

    // Managing shooting action
    pressS(e) -> [command <- shoot(ship)];
}
```

In the `always assume` block, mutual exclusion for key inputs is enforced to ensure that conflicting movements and actions are not processed simultaneously. Each key press condition is handled separately with logical negations (`!`) to prevent overlapping input handling.

In the `always guarantee` block:
- The `hit(ship)` predicate activates the `die(ship)` function, which could represent ending the game or losing a life.
- Movement controls are guarded by boundary checks (`leftmost(ship)` and `rightmost(ship)`), ensuring that the ship does not move beyond the game boundaries.
- The `pressS(e)` condition triggers the `shoot(ship)` function to perform a shooting action in the game. 

This TSL specification aligns with the provided description and ensures that the space ship's behavior is correctly managed according to game rules and input conditions.
