Here's the TSL specification based on the natural language description provided for the behavior of a player's ship in the game Space Invaders:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure mutual exclusion for directional key inputs
  !(pressL && pressR);
  !(pressL && pressUp);
  !(pressL && pressDown);
  !(pressR && pressUp);
  !(pressR && pressDown);
  !(pressUp && pressDown);
}

always guarantee {
  // Handling ship movement to the left, ensuring it does not move left if it is at the leftmost position
  (pressL && !leftmost(ship)) -> [ship <- moveLeft(ship)];

  // Handling ship movement to the right, ensuring it does not move right if it is at the rightmost position
  (pressR && !rightmost(ship)) -> [ship <- moveRight(ship)];

  // Handling shooting action
  pressS -> [ship <- shoot(ship)];

  // Handling the ship being hit; triggering end game or loss of life
  hit(ship) -> [ship <- die(ship)];
}
```

### Explanation
- **Mutual Exclusion for Key Inputs:**
  - The assumptions section ensures that no two conflicting key inputs are allowed at the same time. This avoids any possible conflicts in the commands issued to the ship, ensuring that only one action among moving left, right, up or down, or shooting can occur at any instance.

- **Guarantees:**
  - **Left and Right Movement:**
    - When the left key is pressed and the ship is not at the leftmost position, the ship moves left. Similarly, when the right key is pressed and the ship is not at the rightmost position, the ship moves right.
  - **Shooting Action:**
    - When the shoot key is pressed, the shooting action is executed, which might involve firing a projectile or triggering some other game mechanic.
  - **Ship Hit Detection:**
    - If the ship is hit by an enemy or an obstacle, the appropriate response (like ending the game or losing a life) is triggered.

This TSL specification comprehensively covers the behaviors and constraints described in the natural language specification for a player's ship in a Space Invaders-like game.
