This TSL specification handles the logical behavior of a ship in a Space Invaders-like game. It ensures that conflicting inputs are not processed simultaneously, moves the ship left or right unless it is at the boundary of the game area, allows for shooting, and handles the situation where the ship is hit by an enemy.
