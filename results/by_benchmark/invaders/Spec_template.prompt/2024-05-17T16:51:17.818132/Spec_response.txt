Here is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description for the behavior of a player's ship in the game Space Invaders:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Mutual Exclusion for Key Inputs: No two directional keys can be pressed simultaneously
  !(pressL && pressR);
  !(pressL && pressUp);
  !(pressL && pressDown);
  !(pressR && pressUp);
  !(pressR && pressDown);
  !(pressUp && pressDown);
}

always guarantee {
  // Ship Hit Detection: If hit, end game or lose life.
  hit(ship) -> [die(ship)];

  // Left Movement: If left key is pressed and not at the leftmost, move left
  (pressL && !leftmost(ship)) -> [moveLeft(ship)];

  // Right Movement: If right key is pressed and not at the rightmost, move right
  (pressR && !rightmost(ship)) -> [moveRight(ship)];

  // Shooting Action: If shoot key is pressed, trigger shooting function
  pressS -> [shoot(ship)];
}
```

This TSL specification covers the mutual exclusion of key inputs to ensure that no two movements conflict, the response when the ship is hit, and the actions for moving left, moving right, and shooting based on respective key presses. The conditions `leftmost(ship)` and `rightmost(ship)` are used to prevent the ship from moving beyond the game boundaries.
