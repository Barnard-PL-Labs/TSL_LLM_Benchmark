Here is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description and the functions and predicates related to the behavior of a player's ship in a Space Invaders game:

```tsl
always assume {
    // Mutual Exclusion for Key Inputs
    !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
    !(pressL(e) && pressUp(e));
    !(pressL(e) && pressDown(e));
    !(pressR(e) && pressUp(e));
    !(pressR(e) && pressDown(e));
    !(pressUp(e) && pressDown(e));
}

always guarantee {
    // Ship Hit Detection
    hit(ship) -> [command <- die(ship)];

    // Left Movement
    pressL(e) && !leftmost(ship) -> [ship <- moveLeft(ship)];

    // Right Movement
    pressR(e) && !rightmost(ship) -> [ship <- moveRight(ship)];

    // Shooting Action
    pressS(e) -> [ship <- shoot(ship)];
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Assumptions:** The mutual exclusions make sure that no two directional keys are pressed at the same time, which avoids conflicting commands.

- **Guarantees:**
  - If the ship is hit (`hit(ship)`), the `die(ship)` function is executed, which could end the game or cause the ship to lose a life.
  - When the left key is pressed (`pressL(e)`), and the ship is not already at the leftmost boundary (`!leftmost(ship)`), the ship moves left by triggering `moveLeft(ship)`.
  - When the right key is pressed (`pressR(e)`), and the ship is not at the rightmost boundary (`!rightmost(ship)`), the ship moves right by invoking `moveRight(ship)`.
  - Activating the shoot key (`pressS(e)`) triggers the `shoot(ship)` function, which could represent firing a projectile or some other shooting mechanism.

This TSL specification captures the fundamental mechanics of ship control in Space Invaders, addressing movement restrictions and actions based on player inputs and game conditions.
