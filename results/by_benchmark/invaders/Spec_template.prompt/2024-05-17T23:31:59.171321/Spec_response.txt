Based on the provided natural language description and the included functions and predicates, the following TSL specification can be written to model the behavior of a player's ship in a game like Space Invaders:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Key inputs mutual exclusion
  !(pressL(e) && pressR(e));
  !(pressL(e) && pressUp(e));
  !(pressL(e) && pressDown(e));
  !(pressR(e) && pressUp(e));
  !(pressR(e) && pressDown(e));
  !(pressUp(e) && pressDown(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Movement and actions based on key inputs and game state
  pressL(e) && !leftmost(ship) -> [ ship <- moveLeft(ship) ]; // Move left unless at the leftmost position
  pressR(e) && !rightmost(ship) -> [ ship <- moveRight(ship) ]; // Move right unless at the rightmost position
  pressS(e) -> [ ship <- shoot(ship) ]; // Shoot when shoot key is pressed
  
  // Handle ship being hit
  hit(ship) -> [ ship <- die(ship) ]; // Trigger end game or lose life when hit
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Mutual Exclusion for Key Inputs**: Ensures that no two directional or movement-related keys are pressed simultaneously, which could lead to conflicting commands.

2. **Ship Movement and Shooting**:
   - **Left Movement**: The ship moves left if the left key is pressed and the ship is not at the leftmost edge of the game space.
   - **Right Movement**: Similarly, the ship moves right if the right key is pressed and it's not at the rightmost edge.
   - **Shooting**: Triggers a shooting action when the shoot key is pressed.

3. **Ship Hit Detection**:
   - If the ship is hit by an enemy or an obstacle, it triggers an action which could be ending the game or losing a life, depending on the game design.

This TSL specification effectively dictates the behavior of the ship based on player inputs and game conditions, ensuring clear and predictable responses that align with typical gameplay mechanics in games like Space Invaders.
