Here's the translation of the provided natural language description into a TSL (Temporal Stream Logic) specification:

```TSL
always assume {
    // Mutual exclusion for key inputs to ensure no conflicting movements
    !(pressL && pressR);
    !(pressL && pressU);
    !(pressL && pressD);
    !(pressR && pressU);
    !(pressR && pressD);
    !(pressU && pressD);
}

always guarantee {
    // If the ship is hit, end game or lose a life
    hit(ship) -> [die(ship)];
    
    // Left Movement: move the ship to the left when the left key is pressed
    pressL -> {
        !leftmost(ship) -> [moveLeft(ship)];
    }
    
    // Right Movement: move the ship to the right when the right key is pressed
    pressR -> {
        !rightmost(ship) -> [moveRight(ship)];
    }
    
    // Shooting Action: trigger shooting when the shoot key is pressed
    pressS -> [shoot(ship)];
}
```

### Explanation
- **Mutual Exclusion**: The `assume` block ensures that no two directional keys are pressed simultaneously, avoiding conflicts in movement commands.
- **Hit Detection**: The `guarantee` block listens for when the ship gets hit (`hit(ship)`) and then triggers the appropriate function `die(ship)` to handle game-ending or life-loss logic.
- **Movement**: For left and right movements, the specification checks whether the ship is already at the boundary (`leftmost(ship)` or `rightmost(ship)`) before moving it to prevent going out of the playable area.
- **Shooting**: The shooting action is controlled by the shoot key (`pressS`), which triggers the `shoot(ship)` function.

This specification makes sure the game controls for the ship are responsive, mutually exclusive, and appropriately constrained by the game boundaries.
