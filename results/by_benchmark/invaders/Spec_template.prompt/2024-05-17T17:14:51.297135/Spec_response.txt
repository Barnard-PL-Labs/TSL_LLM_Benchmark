Based on the provided natural language description and utilizing the listed functions and predicates, here's how the behavior of a player's ship in Space Invaders could be outlined using TSL (Temporal Stream Logic):

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure mutual exclusion for directional inputs to avoid conflicting movement commands
  !(pressL && pressR);
  !(pressL && pressUp);
  !(pressL && pressDown);
  !(pressR && pressUp);
  !(pressR && pressDown);
  !(pressUp && pressDown);
}

always guarantee {
  // Handle ship's left movement
  // If the left key is pressed and the ship is not at the leftmost position, move the ship to the left
  pressL && !leftmost(ship) -> [ ship <- moveLeft(ship) ];
  
  // Handle ship's right movement
  // If the right key is pressed and the ship is not at the rightmost position, move the ship to the right
  pressR && !rightmost(ship) -> [ ship <- moveRight(ship) ];
  
  // Handle shooting action
  // If the shoot key is pressed, trigger the shoot function
  pressShoot -> [ ship <- shoot(ship) ];
  
  // Handle ship hit detection
  // If the ship is hit, execute the die function which could end the game or cause the ship to lose a life
  hit(ship) -> [ ship <- die(ship) ];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Mutual Exclusion for Key Inputs**: The `always assume` block ensures that no two conflicting directional keys can be pressed simultaneously, which would otherwise lead to undefined behavior in the game.

2. **Guarantee Block Details**:
   - **Left Movement**: When the left movement key (`pressL`) is pressed and the ship is not already at the leftmost boundary (`leftmost(ship)`), the ship moves to the left by one unit through the `moveLeft(ship)` function.
   - **Right Movement**: Similarly, when the right movement key (`pressR`) is pressed and the ship is not at the rightmost boundary (`rightmost(ship)`), the ship moves to the right by one unit via `moveRight(ship)`.
   - **Shooting Action**: Pressing the shoot key (`pressShoot`) triggers the `shoot(ship)` function, representing the shooting mechanism in the game.
   - **Ship Hit Detection**: If the ship is detected to be hit by an enemy or an obstacle (`hit(ship)`), the `die(ship)` function is called, which could handle the end-game scenario or loss of a life. 

This TSL specification effectively captures and elaborates the behavior of the player's ship in response to game dynamics and player inputs, adhering to the logical constructs and requirements set by the game's mechanics.
