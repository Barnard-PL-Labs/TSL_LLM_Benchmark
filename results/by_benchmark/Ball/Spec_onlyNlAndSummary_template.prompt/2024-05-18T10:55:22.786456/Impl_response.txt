To implement the described methods in JavaScript, you will need to define the functions and predicates based on the behavior described. Let's assume that the `ball` cell has some properties or methods that allow us to update its state or check its position relative to the walls. 

Hereâ€™s how you might define these functions and predicates in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Define the functions and predicates for handling the ball movement

// Assuming 'ball' is an object with properties or methods to control its position

// Function to move the ball to the left
function moveLeft(ball) {
    if (!leftmost(ball)) {
        // Assuming 'ball' has a method 'move' or similar to update its position
        ball.move(-1);  // Move ball one unit to the left
        return "Move left signal sent";
    }
    return "Ball is at the leftmost position";
}

// Function to move the ball to the right
function moveRight(ball) {
    if (!rightmost(ball)) {
        ball.move(1);  // Move ball one unit to the right
        return "Move right signal sent";
    }
    return "Ball is at the rightmost position";
}

// Predicate to check if the ball is at the leftmost wall
function leftmost(ball) {
    // Assuming 'ball' has a property 'x' denoting its horizontal position
    // and 'leftWall' represents the x-coordinate of the leftmost wall
    return ball.x === ball.leftWall;
}

// Predicate to check if the ball is at the rightmost wall
function rightmost(ball) {
    // Assuming 'ball' has a property 'x' and 'rightWall' is the x-coordinate of the rightmost wall
    return ball.x === ball.rightWall;
}
```

**Explanation:**
1. **moveLeft and moveRight Functions:**
   - These functions check whether the ball is already at the respective wall using the `leftmost` and `rightmost` predicates.
   - If not, they move the ball in the respective direction by updating its position (`ball.move(-1)` for left, `ball.move(1)` for right). The exact implementation of `ball.move` depends on how the ball's position is managed in your system. It might involve setting a new position or sending a command to a controller.

2. **leftmost and rightmost Predicates:**
   - These return `true` or `false` based on the current position of the ball (`ball.x`) compared to predefined limits (`ball.leftWall` and `ball.rightWall`). These limits need to be properties of the `ball` or globally known values within your application.

This implementation is generic and assumes certain properties and methods exist on the `ball` object. You might need to adjust the implementation details based on the actual capabilities and API of your system.
