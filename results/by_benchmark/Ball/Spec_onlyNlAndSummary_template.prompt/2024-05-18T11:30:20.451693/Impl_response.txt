To implement the specified functions and predicates in JavaScript, we need to create functions that interact according to your description. These function definitions assume there's an underlying system that provides methods to get and set the state of the ball, and to determine its position (leftmost and rightmost wall).

Hereâ€™s an implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Function to move the ball to the left
function moveLeft(ball) {
    if (!leftmost(ball)) {
        // Assuming there's a method in the API to change the ball's horizontal position to the left
        ball.x -= 1; // Decrease the x-coordinate to move left
        return "Signal to move left"; // Return some signal or command as required
    } else {
        return "Cannot move left"; // Ball is already at the leftmost position
    }
}

// Function to move the ball to the right
function moveRight(ball) {
    if (!rightmost(ball)) {
        // Assuming there's a method in the API to change the ball's horizontal position to the right
        ball.x += 1; // Increase the x-coordinate to move right
        return "Signal to move right"; // Return some signal or command as required
    } else {
        return "Cannot move right"; // Ball is already at the rightmost position
    }
}

// Predicate to check if the ball is at the leftmost wall
function leftmost(ball) {
    // Assuming there's a property or a method to get the minimum x-coordinate
    const leftmostPosition = 0; // This would typically be fetched or calculated based on the playing area dimensions
    return ball.x === leftmostPosition;
}

// Predicate to check if the ball is at the rightmost wall
function rightmost(ball) {
    // Assuming there's a property or a method to get the maximum x-coordinate
    const rightmostPosition = 10; // This would typically be fetched or calculated based on the playing area dimensions
    return ball.x === rightmostPosition;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **moveLeft** and **moveRight** functions check whether the ball is already at the respective boundary using the predicates. If it's not, they adjust the `x` position of the ball.
- **leftmost** and **rightmost** predicates determine if the ball's current `x` position matches the defined boundaries of the playing area (which are assumed to be `0` for the leftmost and `10` for the rightmost in this example).

This pseudocode assumes the existence of a `ball` object with an `x` property. The specifics like the rightmost position value and how movements are signaled (strings in this case) might vary based on the actual system details, including how boundaries and positions are defined and managed in the underlying API.
