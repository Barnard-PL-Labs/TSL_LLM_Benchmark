This TSL specification defines the assumptions and guarantees based on the provided natural language description. Assumptions ensure that the ball behaves logically in terms of its position when moving left or right. Guarantees ensure that the ball moves appropriately when at either wall and maintains valid movement until reaching the opposite wall.
