Here is a TSL specification based on your description of a ball bouncing between two walls:

```tsl
always assume {
  // If the ball is moved to the left, it is not at the rightmost wall in the next moment
  (ball.position <- left) -> X !(ball.position = 10);

  // If the ball is moved to the right, it is not at the leftmost wall in the next moment
  (ball.position <- right) -> X !(ball.position = 0);

  // The ball cannot be at both the leftmost and rightmost wall simultaneously
  !(ball.position = 0 && ball.position = 10);
}

always guarantee {
  // If the ball is at the rightmost wall, eventually it must move to the left
  (ball.position = 10) -> F (ball.position <- left);

  // If the ball is at the leftmost wall, eventually it must move to the right
  (ball.position = 0) -> F (ball.position <- right);

  // If the ball is neither at the leftmost nor at the rightmost wall, eventually move it either left or right
  (!(ball.position = 0) && !(ball.position = 10)) -> F ((ball.position <- left) || (ball.position <- right));

  // If the ball is at the leftmost wall and is going to move away, it must continue moving right until it reaches the rightmost wall
  (ball.position = 0 && X (ball.position <- right)) -> (ball.position <- right) W (ball.position = 10);

  // If the ball is at the rightmost wall and is going to move away, it must continue moving left until it reaches the leftmost wall
  (ball.position = 10 && X (ball.position <- left)) -> (ball.position <- left) W (ball.position = 0);
}
```

This TSL representation captures the dynamics of a ball bouncing between two walls, where the ball's position is altered based on its current location and constraints are established to ensure valid movements within defined boundaries.
