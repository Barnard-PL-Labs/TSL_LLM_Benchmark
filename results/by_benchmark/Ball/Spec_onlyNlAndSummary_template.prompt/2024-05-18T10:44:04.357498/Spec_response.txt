Below is the TSL specification based on the given natural language description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // If the ball is moved to the left, it is not at the rightmost wall in the next state
  (moveLeft -> X !(ballPosition = 10));

  // If the ball is moved to the right, it is not at the leftmost wall in the next state
  (moveRight -> X !(ballPosition = 0));

  // The ball cannot be at both the leftmost and the rightmost wall at the same time
  !(ballPosition = 0 && ballPosition = 10);
}

always guarantee {
  // If the ball is at the rightmost wall, it must eventually be moved to the left
  (ballPosition = 10 -> F moveLeft);

  // If the ball is at the leftmost wall, it must eventually be moved to the right
  (ballPosition = 0 -> F moveRight);

  // If the ball is neither at the leftmost nor at the rightmost wall, it must eventually move
  (!(ballPosition = 0 || ballPosition = 10) -> F (moveLeft || moveRight));

  // If the ball is at the leftmost wall and moving away, it must not move left until it reaches the rightmost wall
  (ballPosition = 0 && X moveRight -> ([ballPosition <- ballPosition + 1] W (ballPosition = 10)));

  // If the ball is at the rightmost wall and moving away, it must not move right until it reaches the leftmost wall
  (ballPosition = 10 && X moveLeft -> ([ballPosition <- ballPosition - 1] W (ballPosition = 0)));
}
```

### Explanation of TSL Specification:

- **Assumptions**:
  1. Moving left means the ball will not be at the rightmost position (position 10) in the next state.
  2. Moving right indicates the ball will not be at the leftmost position (position 0) in the next state.
  3. The ball cannot simultaneously be at the leftmost and rightmost positions.

- **Guarantees**:
  4. The ball must eventually move left if it is at the rightmost position.
  5. The ball must eventually move right if it is at the leftmost position.
  6. If the ball is not at any wall, it must eventually move in either direction.
  7. When leaving the leftmost wall, it should not move left until it reaches the rightmost wall.
  8. When leaving the rightmost wall, it should not move right until it reaches the leftmost wall.

This TSL specification defines a system to handle the behavior of a ball bouncing between two walls, setting constraints on the ball's movement based on its position.
