  ((position == 0) && X (position > 0)) -> [position <- position + 1] W (position == 10);

This TSL code reflects the descriptions provided:

1. If the ball moves left, the next state cannot find the ball at the rightmost wall (position 10).
2. If the ball moves right, the next state cannot find the ball at the leftmost wall (position 0).
3. The ball can't simultaneously be at both walls.

Guarantees ensure that:
1. When the ball is at the rightmost wall, it is eventually moved left.
2. When the ball is at the leftmost wall, it is eventually moved right.
3. If it's somewhere in between, it will be moved either left or right soon.
4. If moving away from the left wall (position 0), it will keep moving right until it hits the rightmost wall (position 10).
5. If moving away from the right wall (position 10), it will keep moving left until it hits the leftmost wall (position 0).
