Here is the TSL specification for the described scenario of a ball bouncing between two walls:

```tsl
always assume {
  (moveLeft -> X !(position == 10));
  (moveRight -> X !(position == 0));
  !(position == 0 && position == 10);
}

always guarantee {
  (position == 10) -> F (moveLeft);
  (position == 0) -> F (moveRight);
  (!(position == 0 || position == 10)) -> F (moveLeft || moveRight);
  ((position == 0 && X !(position == 0)) -> (!moveLeft W (position == 10)));
  ((position == 10 && X !(position == 10)) -> (!moveRight W (position == 0)));
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Assumption Block:**
  1. If the ball is moved to the left (`moveLeft`), then in the next moment (`X`), it is guaranteed that the ball is not at the rightmost wall (`!(position == 10)`).
  2. If the ball is moved to the right (`moveRight`), then in the next moment, it is ensured that the ball is not at the leftmost wall (`!(position == 0)`).
  3. It is always the case that the ball cannot be at both the leftmost and the rightmost wall at the same time (`!(position == 0 && position == 10)`).

- **Guarantee Block:**
  4. If the ball is at the rightmost wall (`position == 10`), it must eventually (`F`) be moved to the left (`moveLeft`).
  5. If the ball is at the leftmost wall (`position == 0`), it must eventually be moved to the right (`moveRight`).
  6. If the ball is neither at the leftmost nor at the rightmost wall, then eventually, it must be moved either to the left or to the right (`moveLeft || moveRight`).
  7. If the ball is at the leftmost wall and is going to move away from it in the next moment, it must continue not moving to the left until it reaches the rightmost wall (`!moveLeft W (position == 10)`).
  8. If the ball is at the rightmost wall and is going to move away from it in the next moment, it must continue not moving to the right until it reaches the leftmost wall (`!moveRight W (position == 0)`).
