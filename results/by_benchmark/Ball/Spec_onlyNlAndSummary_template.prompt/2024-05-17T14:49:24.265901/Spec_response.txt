```tsl
always assume {
  (ball.moveLeft -> X !(ball.position == 10));
  (ball.moveRight -> X !(ball.position == 0));
  !(ball.position == 0 && ball.position == 10);
}

always guarantee {
  (ball.position == 10) -> F (ball.moveLeft);
  (ball.position == 0) -> F (ball.moveRight);
  (!(ball.position == 0 || ball.position == 10)) -> F (ball.moveLeft || ball.moveRight);
  (ball.position == 0 && X !(ball.position == 0)) -> G !(ball.moveLeft) W (ball.position == 10);
  (ball.position == 10 && X !(ball.position == 10)) -> G !(ball.moveRight) W (ball.position == 0);
}
```

### Explanation:

**Assumptions:**
1. If the ball moves left, then in the next state, it cannot be at the rightmost wall (position 10).
2. If the ball moves right, then in the next state, it cannot be at the leftmost wall (position 0).
3. The ball cannot be at both walls (positions 0 and 10) simultaneously.

**Guarantees:**
4. If the ball is at the rightmost wall (position 10), it must eventually move left.
5. If the ball is at the leftmost wall (position 0), it must eventually move right.
6. If the ball is not at either the leftmost or the rightmost wall, it must eventually move either left or right.
7. If the ball is at the leftmost wall and is about to move away, it should continuously not move left until it reaches the rightmost wall.
8. If the ball is at the rightmost wall and is about to move away, it should continuously not move right until it reaches the leftmost wall.
