To implement the specified `functions` and `predicates` for managing the movement of a ball in a JavaScript environment without a specific API wrapper, you can assume that the "ball" object has properties and methods that allow for checking its position and updating its movement direction. We'll create JavaScript functions that check if the ball is at the leftmost or rightmost position and functions to move the ball left or right based on the descriptions provided.

Here's a possible implementation of the functionality:

```javascript
// Assuming 'ball' is an object that contains properties 'x', 'minX', and 'maxX'
// for its current horizontal position, and the minimal and maximal x positions respectively.

// Functions
function moveLeft(ball) {
    // Move the ball to the left by decrementing the x position.
    // Ensure ball does not move beyond the leftmost boundary.
    if (ball.x > ball.minX) {
        ball.x--;
        return 'Signal to move left';
    }
    return 'Already at leftmost position';
}

function moveRight(ball) {
    // Move the ball to the right by incrementing the x position.
    // Ensure ball does not move beyond the rightmost boundary.
    if (ball.x < ball.maxX) {
        ball.x++;
        return 'Signal to move right';
    }
    return 'Already at rightmost position';
}

// Predicates
function leftmost(ball) {
    // Check if the ball is at the leftmost position.
    return ball.x === ball.minX;
}

function rightmost(ball) {
    // Check if the ball is at the rightmost position.
    return ball.x === ball.maxX;
}

// Example usage:
// Assuming we have a ball object initialized like so:
let ball = {
    x: 5,
    minX: 0,
    maxX: 10
};

console.log(moveLeft(ball)); // Should log 'Signal to move left' and decrement x
console.log(moveRight(ball)); // Should log 'Signal to move right' and increment x
console.log(leftmost(ball)); // Should return false, unless x equals minX
console.log(rightmost(ball)); // Should return false, unless x equals maxX
```

### Explanation:
1. **moveLeft(ball)**: This function checks if the ball's current position `x` is greater than the minimum allowed position `minX`. If it is not at the minimum, it decrements the `x` value to move the ball left. Otherwise, it indicates that the ball is already at the leftmost position.

2. **moveRight(ball)**: This function does the opposite of `moveLeft`. It checks if the ball's `x` position is less than the maximum allowed position `maxX` and increments the `x` value if possible. If the ball is already at the maximum boundary, it returns a message indicating so.

3. **leftmost(ball)** and **rightmost(ball)**: These predicates check whether the ball is at the leftmost or rightmost positions by comparing the `x` value with `minX` and `maxX` respectively.

This approach assumes the existence of a simplistic model for the ball's position management within a possibly larger game or simulation environment, where `x`, `minX`, and `maxX` are maintained and updated. Adjustments might be needed based on how the ball's position and boundaries are actually managed in your specific application environment.
