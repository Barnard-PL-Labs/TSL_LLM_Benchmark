Here's how you can translate the given natural language description into a TSL specification:

```tsl
always assume {
  // If the ball is moved to the left, the next moment it is not at the rightmost wall.
  [moveLeft() -> X !(position == 10)];
  
  // If the ball is moved to the right, the next moment it is not at the leftmost wall.
  [moveRight() -> X !(position == 0)];

  // It is always the case that the ball cannot be at both the leftmost and the rightmost wall at the same time.
  !(position == 0 && position == 10);
}

always guarantee {
  // If the ball is at the rightmost wall, eventually it must be moved to the left.
  (position == 10) -> F [moveLeft()];

  // If the ball is at the leftmost wall, eventually it must be moved to the right.
  (position == 0) -> F [moveRight()];

  // If the ball is neither at the leftmost nor at the rightmost wall, then eventually, it must be moved either to the left or to the right.
  (position != 0 && position != 10) -> F ([moveLeft()] || [moveRight()]);

  // If the ball is at the leftmost wall and is going to move away from it in the next moment,
  // it must continue not moving to the left until it reaches the rightmost wall.
  (position == 0 -> X [moveRight()]) -> ([moveLeft() -> false] W (position == 10));

  // If the ball is at the rightmost wall and is going to move away from it in the next moment,
  // it must continue not moving to the right until it reaches the leftmost wall.
  (position == 10 -> X [moveLeft()]) -> ([moveRight() -> false] W (position == 0));
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Assumptions**:
  - The first two conditions ensure that if the ball is moved left or right, in the next state, it isn't at the opposite end.
  - The third condition asserts the ball cannot be at both boundaries simultaneously.

- **Guarantees**:
  - Conditions 4 and 5 ensure that if the ball reaches either boundary, it must be eventually moved away from that wall.
  - Condition 6 accounts for the ball being between walls and ensures it eventually moves in one direction or the other.
  - Conditions 7 and 8 handle the continuity of movement from one wall towards the other without reversing direction.
