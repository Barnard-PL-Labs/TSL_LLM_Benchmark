Translating the provided natural language description into a Temporal Stream Logic (TSL) specification involves structuring the assumptions and guarantees based on the behavior of the ball as it moves between two walls, represented by positions 0 to 10. Here's how the TSL specification could be structured:

```tsl
always assume {
  // If the ball is moved to the left, then in the next moment, it is guaranteed that the ball is not at the rightmost wall.
  (moveLeft -> X !(ball.position = 10));

  // If the ball is moved to the right, then in the next moment, it is ensured that the ball is not at the leftmost wall.
  (moveRight -> X !(ball.position = 0));

  // It is always the case that the ball cannot be at both the leftmost and the rightmost wall at the same time.
  !(ball.position = 0 && ball.position = 10);
}

always guarantee {
  // If the ball is at the rightmost wall, eventually it must be moved to the left.
  (ball.position = 10 -> F moveLeft);

  // If the ball is at the leftmost wall, eventually it must be moved to the right.
  (ball.position = 0 -> F moveRight);

  // If the ball is neither at the leftmost nor at the rightmost wall, then eventually, it must be moved either to the left or to the right.
  (!(ball.position = 0) && !(ball.position = 10) -> F (moveLeft || moveRight));

  // If the ball is at the leftmost wall and is going to move away from it in the next moment, it must continue not moving to the left until it reaches the rightmost wall.
  (ball.position = 0 && X moveRight -> (!moveLeft W ball.position = 10));

  // If the ball is at the rightmost wall and is going to move away from it in the next moment, it must continue not moving to the right until it reaches the leftmost wall.
  (ball.position = 10 && X moveLeft -> (!moveRight W ball.position = 0));
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions**:
    - If `moveLeft` is triggered, the next state ensures the ball is not at position 10.
    - If `moveRight` is triggered, the next state ensures the ball is not at position 0.
    - The ball cannot be at both position 0 and 10 simultaneously.

2. **Guarantees**:
    - If the ball reaches position 10, it must eventually move left.
    - If the ball is at position 0, it must eventually move right.
    - For any position between 0 and 10, the ball must eventually move left or right.
    - Detailed guarantees ensure that if a movement direction is decided from an extreme position (either 0 or 10), the ball will continue in that direction until it reaches the opposite wall, without reversing direction.
