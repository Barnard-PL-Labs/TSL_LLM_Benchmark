To implement the requested functions and predicates in JavaScript for the given system with a `ball` cell representing the state of the signal that determines the ball's movement, you can follow this structure. Since there's no additional context about how the `ball` cell is structured or how it interacts with the system, I'll provide a general example that assumes the `ball` object has `position` and `maxPosition` properties.

Here is a basic implementation:

### JavaScript Code:

```javascript
// Assuming 'ball' is an object with 'position' and possibly 'maxPosition' to determine boundaries

/**
 * Moves the ball to the left by decreasing its position.
 * @param {Object} ball The ball object with its current state.
 * @returns {Object} Updated state of the ball after moving left.
 */
function moveLeft(ball) {
    if (!leftmost(ball)) { // Check to prevent moving past the left boundary
        ball.position -= 1;
    }
    return ball;
}

/**
 * Moves the ball to the right by increasing its position.
 * @param {Object} ball The ball object with its current state.
 * @returns {Object} Updated state of the ball after moving right.
 */
function moveRight(ball) {
    if (!rightmost(ball)) { // Check to prevent moving past the right boundary
        ball.position += 1;
    }
    return ball;
}

/**
 * Checks if the ball is against the leftmost wall.
 * @param {Object} ball The ball object with its current state.
 * @returns {boolean} True if the ball is at the leftmost position, otherwise false.
 */
function leftmost(ball) {
    return ball.position === 0; // Assuming '0' is the leftmost position
}

/**
 * Checks if the ball is against the rightmost wall.
 * @param {Object} ball The ball object with its current state.
 * @returns {boolean} True if the ball is at the rightmost position, otherwise false.
 */
function rightmost(ball) {
    return ball.position === ball.maxPosition; // Assuming 'maxPosition' is the rightmost position
}

// Example usage:
let ball = { position: 5, maxPosition: 10 };

// Move ball
console.log("Initial Position:", ball.position);
ball = moveRight(ball);
console.log("Position after moving right:", ball.position);
ball = moveLeft(ball);
console.log("Position after moving left:", ball.position);

// Check positions
console.log("Is leftmost?", leftmost(ball));
console.log("Is rightmost?", rightmost(ball));
```

### Notes:

1. **Boundary Checking**: Both `moveLeft` and `moveRight` functions check whether the ball is at the boundary before moving it. This prevents the ball from moving beyond the playable area.
   
2. **State Management**: The ball's state is passed around and modified directly. Depending on the API's capabilities and requirements, you might need to adjust how state is managed or updated.

3. **Testing**: The example includes simple log statements to demonstrate the functionality. You should consider more robust testing to ensure all edge cases are handled (like moving left from the leftmost position).

This JavaScript implementation provides a basic framework and can be expanded or refined based on more specific details of the system's API and how the ball's state is stored and retrieved.
