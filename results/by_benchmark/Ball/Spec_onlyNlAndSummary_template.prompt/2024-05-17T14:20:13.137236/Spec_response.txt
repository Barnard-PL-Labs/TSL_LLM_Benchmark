To translate your natural language description into TSL code for the scenario of a ball bouncing between two walls, we can structure the TSL specification as follows:

```tsl
always assume {
  // If the ball moves left, it is not at the rightmost wall in the next state
  ([ ball.position <- ball.position - 1 ] -> X !(ball.position = 10));

  // If the ball moves right, it is not at the leftmost wall in the next state
  ([ ball.position <- ball.position + 1 ] -> X !(ball.position = 0));

  // The ball cannot be at both the leftmost and rightmost wall at the same time
  !(ball.position = 0 && ball.position = 10);
}

always guarantee {
  // If the ball is at the rightmost wall, eventually it must be moved to the left
  (ball.position = 10 -> F ([ ball.position <- ball.position - 1 ]));

  // If the ball is at the leftmost wall, eventually it must be moved to the right
  (ball.position = 0 -> F ([ ball.position <- ball.position + 1 ]));

  // If the ball is neither at the leftmost nor the rightmost wall, then eventually, it must be moved either left or right
  (!(ball.position = 0 || ball.position = 10) -> F ([ ball.position <- ball.position + 1 ] || [ ball.position <- ball.position - 1 ]));

  // If the ball is at the leftmost wall and is going to move away from it in the next moment, it must continue not moving to the left until it reaches the rightmost wall
  (ball.position = 0 -> X ([ ball.position <- ball.position + 1 ]) W (ball.position = 10));

  // If the ball is at the rightmost wall and is going to move away from it in the next moment, it must continue not moving to the right until it reaches the leftmost wall
  (ball.position = 10 -> X ([ ball.position <- ball.position - 1 ]) W (ball.position = 0));
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions**:
   - The assumptions ensure that movement rules are adhered to relative to the ball's position. If the ball moves in one direction, then at the next timestep, it cannot suddenly appear at the opposite extreme.
   - The additional assumption prevents a logical impossibility of the ball being at two places at once.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - The guarantees manage the requirement of the ball's movement based on its position, ensuring it behaves as expected when at boundary positions (against either wall) or somewhere in between.
   - The use of 'eventually' (F) and 'until' (W) operators defines necessary actions that must be taken when at boundary conditions to ensure the ball continues to "bounce" correctly.

This TSL specification should correctly model the behavior of a ball bouncing back and forth between two walls based on the provided natural language description.
