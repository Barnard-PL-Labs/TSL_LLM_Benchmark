To implement the specified functions and predicates in JavaScript based on the provided description, here's how you can write the code. Since the actual implementation of how a "ball" object is handled isn't given, I'll assume a simplistic model where `ball` might be an object that tracks its position along an axis (like an x-axis).

Let's define the functions and predicates:

```javascript
// Assuming that the ball object has properties such as 'x' for its position,
// 'xmin' for the leftmost boundary, and 'xmax' for the rightmost boundary.

/**
 * Function to move the ball to the left.
 * @param {Object} ball - The ball object with its current position.
 * @returns {Object} Updated ball object with new position.
 */
function moveLeft(ball) {
    // Decrements the x position of the ball, with a boundary check
    if (ball.x > ball.xmin) {
        ball.x -= 1;
    }
    return ball;
}

/**
 * Function to move the ball to the right.
 * @param {Object} ball - The ball object with its current position.
 * @returns {Object} Updated ball object with new position.
 */
function moveRight(ball) {
    // Increments the x position of the ball, with a boundary check
    if (ball.x < ball.xmax) {
        ball.x += 1;
    }
    return ball;
}

/**
 * Predicate to determine if the ball is at the leftmost position.
 * @param {Object} ball - The ball object with its current position.
 * @returns {boolean} True if the ball is at the leftmost position, false otherwise.
 */
function leftmost(ball) {
    return ball.x === ball.xmin;
}

/**
 * Predicate to determine if the ball is at the rightmost position.
 * @param {Object} ball - The ball object with its current position.
 * @returns {boolean} True if the ball is at the rightmost position, false otherwise.
 */
function rightmost(ball) {
    return ball.x === ball.xmax;
}
```

### Notes:
1. **Boundary Conditions**: Functions `moveLeft` and `moveRight` include boundary checks to ensure that moving the ball does not go beyond specified limits (`xmin` and `xmax`).
2. **Return Types**: Predicates `leftmost` and `rightmost` return a boolean value based on the position comparison with boundary attributes.
3. **Ball Object**: The structure of `ball` is assumed for demonstration. It contains `x` for position, `xmin` for the minimum limit, and `xmax` for the maximum limit. Modify these properties based on actual implementation details.

This implementation assumes you have some environment or setup where the ball object's properties (`x`, `xmin`, `xmax`) are initialized and handled correctly. Adjustments may be needed depending on the actual system specifications and how the ball's state is tracked and represented in your application.
