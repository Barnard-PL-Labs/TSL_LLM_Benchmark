To implement the functions and predicates outlined in JavaScript, we will assume that the `ball` object represents the state of a ball in a hypothetical game or simulation environment. This object might contain properties like position, but since it is not specified, our implementations will work abstractly with this object. We will define the movement functions `moveLeft` and `moveRight` and predicates `leftmost` and `rightmost`.

Here's a simple implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * Functions to manipulate the 'ball' cell
 */

// Function to move the ball to the left
function moveLeft(ball) {
    // Assuming there's a property 'position' in ball to decrement
    ball.position.x -= 1;
    return ball; // Returns the modified ball object
}

// Function to move the ball to the right
function moveRight(ball) {
    // Assuming there's a property 'position' in ball to increment
    ball.position.x += 1;
    return ball; // Returns the modified ball object
}

/**
 * Predicates to check ball positions
 */

// Predicate to check if the ball is against the leftmost wall
function leftmost(ball) {
    // Assuming there's a known minimum x-position that represents the leftmost wall
    const LEFT_WALL_X = 0;
    return ball.position.x <= LEFT_WALL_X;
}

// Predicate to check if the ball is against the rightmost wall
function rightmost(ball) {
    // Assuming there's a known maximum x-position that represents the rightmost wall
    const RIGHT_WALL_X = 10; // Example value, should be set according to actual bounds
    return ball.position.x >= RIGHT_WALL_X;
}

/**
 * Example usage
 */

// Assuming we are initializing the ball object
let ball = {
    position: {
        x: 5,
        y: 0
    }
};

// Move the ball and check positions
console.log("Initial Position:", ball.position);
moveLeft(ball);
console.log("After moving left:", ball.position);
console.log("Is at leftmost:", leftmost(ball));
moveRight(ball);
moveRight(ball);
console.log("After moving right twice:", ball.position);
console.log("Is at rightmost:", rightmost(ball));
```

### Notes:
1. **Position Handling**: The implementations of `moveLeft` and `moveRight` assume that the `ball` object has a property `position` with an x-coordinate that can be incremented or decremented. If `ball` is structured differently, these functions will need to be adjusted accordingly.

2. **Boundary Constants**: The `leftmost` and `rightmost` functions use constants `LEFT_WALL_X` and `RIGHT_WALL_X` to determine the boundaries of the playing area. These will need to be set to appropriate values that represent the bounds of your game or simulation environment.

3. **Return Value**: The movement functions return the `ball` object after modifying it. This could be useful if you need to chain commands or check the state of the ball after a movement within the same line of code.

4. **API Integration**: Since the problem statement mentions an API but does not specify its methods or properties, the actual integration with a real API may require adjustments to these functions, particularly how the ball's position is read and written.
