To implement the methods described using JavaScript in a hypothetical system environment, we can create a simple structure assuming that the "ball" has properties to determine its position on a horizontal line. For instance, let's define "ball" as an object with a property `position` to indicate its horizontal location. We will also define the scope of the environment, such as a line or a grid where the ball can move.

Given that we don't have explicit details about the environment's API or the full structure of the "ball" object, I'll make reasonable assumptions for this demonstration:

```javascript
// Define the ball object. Assuming 'position' is a number indicating the horizontal position of the ball.
let ball = {
    position: 0
};

// Define the environment's limits (assuming a simple line from position 0 to 10)
const LEFTMOST_POSITION = 0;
const RIGHTMOST_POSITION = 10;

// Functions
function moveLeft(ball) {
    if (ball.position > LEFTMOST_POSITION) {
        ball.position -= 1; // Move the ball to the left by decreasing its position
    }
    return `Signal to move left: new position is ${ball.position}`;
}

function moveRight(ball) {
    if (ball.position < RIGHTMOST_POSITION) {
        ball.position += 1; // Move the ball to the right by increasing its position
    }
    return `Signal to move right: new position is ${ball.position}`;
}

// Predicates
function leftmost(ball) {
    return ball.position === LEFTMOST_POSITION; // Check if the ball is at the leftmost position
}

function rightmost(ball) {
    return ball.position === RIGHTMOST_POSITION; // Check if the ball is at the rightmost position
}

// Example Usage:
console.log(moveRight(ball)); // Moves the ball right
console.log(moveRight(ball)); // Moves the ball right again
console.log(leftmost(ball));  // Checks if the ball is at the leftmost position
console.log(rightmost(ball)); // Checks if the ball is at the rightmost position
console.log(moveLeft(ball));  // Moves the ball left

```

Here, the `moveLeft` and `moveRight` functions adjust the `position` of the `ball` object within defined boundaries (LEFTMOST_POSITION and RIGHTMOST_POSITION). They also return a string indicating the action taken, which simulates a "signal". The `leftmost` and `rightmost` predicates return boolean values based on whether the ball is at the respective boundary.

This setup assumes a very simple linear environment. If the environment's complexity increases (e.g., multidimensional space, dynamic boundaries), these functions and predicates would need to be adapted accordingly. Additionally, if the system API provides specific methods for moving objects or querying positions, those should be integrated into the functions.
