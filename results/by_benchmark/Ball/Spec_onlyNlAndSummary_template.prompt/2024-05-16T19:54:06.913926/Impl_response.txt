To implement the specified functions and predicates in JavaScript, we first need to define how the `ball` state is represented and how the `moveLeft` and `moveRight` functions will manipulate this state. Since `ball` is a cell that represents the state of the signal for ball movement, we assume it contains properties that can be used to determine its position, like `x` for horizontal position. 

Here's a possible JavaScript implementation:

```javascript
class Ball {
    constructor(x) {
        this.x = x; // x represents the horizontal position of the ball
    }

    // Function to move the ball left
    moveLeft() {
        if (!this.leftmost()) { // Check if it's not at the leftmost position
            this.x -= 1;  // Move the ball left by decreasing x
            return "Signal to move left";
        }
        return "Ball is at the leftmost position, cannot move left";
    }

    // Function to move the ball right
    moveRight() {
        if (!this.rightmost()) { // Check if it's not at the rightmost position
            this.x += 1;  // Move the ball right by increasing x
            return "Signal to move right";
        }
        return "Ball is at the rightmost position, cannot move right";
    }

    // Predicate to check if the ball is at the leftmost position
    leftmost() {
        const leftMostWallPosition = 0; // Assuming 0 is the leftmost position
        return this.x === leftMostWallPosition;
    }

    // Predicate to check if the ball is at the rightmost position
    rightmost() {
        const rightMostWallPosition = 10; // Assuming 10 is the rightmost position
        return this.x === rightMostWallPosition;
    }
}

// Usage example
const ball = new Ball(5); // Create a ball at position 5
console.log(ball.moveLeft()); // Moves ball to the left
console.log(ball.moveLeft()); // Moves ball to the left again
console.log(ball.moveRight()); // Moves ball to the right
console.log(ball.leftmost()); // Checks if at the leftmost position
console.log(ball.rightmost()); // Checks if at the rightmost position
```

### Explanation:
- **Ball Class**: Represents the ball with an `x` position. Contains methods to move the ball left or right, and predicates to check if it's at the leftmost or rightmost position.
- **moveLeft()** and **moveRight()**: These methods change the `x` position of the ball if it's not already at the boundary walls. Returns a signal string based on the movement or inability to move.
- **leftmost()** and **rightmost()**: These predicates return `true` or `false` based on whether the ball is at the respective wall positions. The positions of the walls are set as constants inside the predicates.
- **Usage Example**: Demonstrates creating a `Ball` instance and interacting with it through the defined methods.

This class-based approach encapsulates all related functionalities and checks within the `Ball` object, making it easy to manage and use in a JavaScript environment. Adjust the `rightMostWallPosition` based on the actual dimensions of your system if needed.
