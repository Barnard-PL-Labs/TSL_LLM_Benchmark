Here is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description of a ball bouncing between two walls:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Assumption 1: If the ball is moved to the left, then in the next moment, it is not at the rightmost wall.
  ([ ball.direction <- left ] -> X !(ball.position = 10));

  // Assumption 2: If the ball is moved to the right, then in the next moment, it is not at the leftmost wall.
  ([ ball.direction <- right ] -> X !(ball.position = 0));

  // Assumption 3: The ball cannot be at both the leftmost and the rightmost wall at the same time.
  !(ball.position = 0 && ball.position = 10);
}

always guarantee {
  // Guarantee 4: If the ball is at the rightmost wall, eventually it must be moved to the left.
  (ball.position = 10 -> F ([ ball.direction <- left ]));

  // Guarantee 5: If the ball is at the leftmost wall, eventually it must be moved to the right.
  (ball.position = 0 -> F ([ ball.direction <- right ]));

  // Guarantee 6: If the ball is neither at the leftmost nor at the rightmost wall, then eventually, it must be moved either to the left or to the right.
  (!(ball.position = 0 || ball.position = 10) -> F ([ ball.direction <- left ] || [ ball.direction <- right ]));

  // Guarantee 7: If the ball is at the leftmost wall and is going to move away from it in the next moment, it must continue not moving to the left until it reaches the rightmost wall.
  (ball.position = 0 -> ([ ball.direction <- right ] W (ball.position = 10)));

  // Guarantee 8: If the ball is at the rightmost wall and is going to move away from it in the next moment, it must continue not moving to the right until it reaches the leftmost wall.
  (ball.position = 10 -> ([ ball.direction <- left ] W (ball.position = 0)));
}
```

### Explanation:
- The `always assume` block contains the conditions or facts that are always true about the environment or the system's behavior that are assumed to be true.
- The `always guarantee` block contains the conditions or rules that the system should ensure or guarantee based on the input conditions or its own state.
- The use of `X` operator for the next state, `F` for eventually, and `W` for weak until, helps structure the behavior of the ball as it interacts with the boundaries defined by the two walls.
