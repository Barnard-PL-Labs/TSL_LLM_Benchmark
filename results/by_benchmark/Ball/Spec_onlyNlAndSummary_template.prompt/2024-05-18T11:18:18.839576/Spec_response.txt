Here is the translated TSL specification based on the provided natural language description:

```TSL
always assume {
  // 1. If the ball is moved to the left, then in the next moment, it is guaranteed that the ball is not at the rightmost wall.
  (moveLeft -> X !(position == 10)) ;
  
  // 2. If the ball is moved to the right, then in the next moment, it is ensured that the ball is not at the leftmost wall.
  (moveRight -> X !(position == 0)) ;
  
  // 3. It is always the case that the ball cannot be at both the leftmost and the rightmost wall at the same time.
  !(position == 0 && position == 10) ;
}

always guarantee {
  // 4. If the ball is at the rightmost wall, eventually it must be moved to the left.
  (position == 10) -> F moveLeft ;

  // 5. If the ball is at the leftmost wall, eventually it must be moved to the right.
  (position == 0) -> F moveRight ;

  // 6. If the ball is neither at the leftmost nor at the rightmost wall, then eventually, it must be moved either to the left or to the right.
  (!(position == 0 || position == 10)) -> F (moveLeft || moveRight) ;
  
  // 7. If the ball is at the leftmost wall and is going to move away from it in the next moment, it must continue not moving to the left until it reaches the rightmost wall.
  (position == 0 && X moveRight) -> (!moveLeft W (position == 10)) ;

  // 8. If the ball is at the rightmost wall and is going to move away from it in the next moment, it must continue not moving to the right until it reaches the leftmost wall.
  (position == 10 && X moveLeft) -> (!moveRight W (position == 0)) ;
}
```

### Explanation
- `moveLeft` and `moveRight` are actions that change the position of the ball.
- `position == 0` and `position == 10` check if the ball is at the leftmost or rightmost wall, respectively.
- `X` refers to the next state in time, ensuring that after a specific action, the resulting position is immediately affected as expected.
- `F` refers to "finally", indicating that a certain state must be reached eventually.
- `W` refers to "weak until", ensuring a condition holds until another condition becomes true, or indefinitely if the second condition never becomes true.
