To implement the specified functions and predicates using JavaScript for controlling the movement of a ball within a given framework, you can define the following JavaScript functions. Assuming the `ball` object has properties to control and check its position, here's how you could write the required functions and predicates:

### Functions:
These functions are tasked with sending signals to move the ball left or right. Given that the actual logic for how the ball moves isn't specified in the system API, these functions will simply return a string that represents the direction the ball should move. In a practical scenario, you would likely update properties of the `ball` or call methods on the `ball` object to change its state.

```javascript
function moveLeft(ball) {
    // Assuming we send a signal or call a method to move the ball to the left
    // Here we just return a string as a placeholder
    return 'move left';
}

function moveRight(ball) {
    // Assuming we send a signal or call a method to move the ball to the right
    // Here we just return a string as a placeholder
    return 'move right';
}
```

### Predicates:
These are functions that return a boolean value based on whether the ball is at the leftmost or rightmost positions. Assuming the `ball` object has a property `position` and properties `minX` and `maxX` which define the edges of the playing field:

```javascript
function leftmost(ball) {
    // Check if the ball's current position is equal to the minimum X boundary
    return ball.position === ball.minX;
}

function rightmost(ball) {
    // Check if the ball's current position is equal to the maximum X boundary
    return ball.position === ball.maxX;
}
```

### Example Usage:
Here's how you might use these functions within your program:

```javascript
// Example ball object
let ball = {
    position: 0,
    minX: 0,
    maxX: 10
};

// Moving the ball
console.log(moveLeft(ball));  // Expected output: 'move left'
console.log(moveRight(ball)); // Expected output: 'move right'

// Checking positions
console.log(leftmost(ball));  // Expected output: true or false depending on the position
console.log(rightmost(ball)); // Expected output: true or false depending on the position
```

### Notes:
- The actual movement logic (i.e., changing the `position` of the ball) is not implemented here since the system API specifics are not provided. The functions `moveLeft` and `moveRight` are placeholders that suggest a direction rather than perform an action.
- The predicates `leftmost` and `rightmost` assume the presence of `position`, `minX`, and `maxX` properties on the `ball` object. Adjust these assumptions based on the actual structure of the ball object in your environment.
