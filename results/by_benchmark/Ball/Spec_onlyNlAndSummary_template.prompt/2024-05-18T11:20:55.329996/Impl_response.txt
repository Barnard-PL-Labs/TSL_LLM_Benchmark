Here is a JavaScript implementation for the "functions" and "predicates" specified, based on a hypothetical API. These implementations assume the system manages a cell named "ball" that represents the position of a ball in a game or simulation environment, where the ball can move left or right and has boundary constraints.

```javascript
// Define the functions

/**
 * Sends a signal to move the ball to the left
 * @param {Cell} ball - The cell that represents the ball's position
 * @returns {Signal} - A signal to move the ball to the left
 */
function moveLeft(ball) {
    return ball.set(ball.get() - 1); // Assuming ball.get() returns the current position, and ball.set() updates the position
}

/**
 * Sends a signal to move the ball to the right
 * @param {Cell} ball - The cell that represents the ball's position
 * @returns {Signal} - A signal to move the ball to the right
 */
function moveRight(ball) {
    return ball.set(ball.get() + 1);
}

// Define the predicates

/**
 * Checks if the ball is at the leftmost position
 * @param {Cell} ball - The cell that represents the ball's position
 * @returns {boolean} - True if the ball is at the leftmost position, otherwise false
 */
function leftmost(ball) {
    return ball.get() === 0; // Assuming 0 is the leftmost position
}

/**
 * Checks if the ball is at the rightmost position
 * @param {Cell} ball - The cell that represents the ball's position
 * @returns {boolean} - True if the ball is at the rightmost position, otherwise false
 */
function rightmost(ball) {
    const rightBoundary = 10; // Assuming 10 is the rightmost position
    return ball.get() === rightBoundary;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **moveLeft and moveRight Functions**:
   - These functions manipulate the "ball" cell by changing its position using `ball.set()` method. The `ball.get()` method is assumed to retrieve the current position of the ball. Moving left decreases the position by 1, while moving right increases it by 1.

2. **leftmost and rightmost Predicates**:
   - These predicates check the position of the "ball" cell. The `leftmost` function returns `true` if the ball is at position 0, assuming 0 is the leftmost possible value. The `rightmost` function checks if the ball is at the rightmost boundary (assumed as 10 here for demonstration) and returns `true` if so.

### Assumptions:
- That the "ball" cell's position can be manipulated and retrieved using `ball.set()` and `ball.get()` respectively.
- The leftmost and rightmost boundaries are fixed as 0 and 10 respectively. This can be adjusted based on the actual constraints of your environment.
