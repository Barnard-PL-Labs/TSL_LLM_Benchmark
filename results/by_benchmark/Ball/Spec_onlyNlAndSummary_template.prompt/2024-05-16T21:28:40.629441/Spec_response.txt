Here's the TSL specification for the given natural language description about the ball bouncing between two walls:

```tsl
always assume {
  (ball.moveLeft -> X !(ball.position = 10));
  (ball.moveRight -> X !(ball.position = 0));
  !(ball.position = 0 && ball.position = 10);
}

always guarantee {
  (ball.position = 10) -> F (ball.moveLeft);
  (ball.position = 0) -> F (ball.moveRight);
  (!(ball.position = 0 || ball.position = 10)) -> F (ball.moveLeft || ball.moveRight);
  (ball.position = 0 && X !(ball.moveLeft)) -> G (!(ball.moveLeft) W (ball.position = 10));
  (ball.position = 10 && X !(ball.moveRight)) -> G (!(ball.moveRight) W (ball.position = 0));
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Assumptions:**
  1. `ball.moveLeft -> X !(ball.position = 10)`: If the ball is moved left, then in the next state, it cannot be at the rightmost wall (position 10).
  2. `ball.moveRight -> X !(ball.position = 0)`: If the ball is moved right, then in the next state, it cannot be at the leftmost wall (position 0).
  3. `!(ball.position = 0 && ball.position = 10)`: The ball cannot be at both position 0 and position 10 simultaneously.

- **Guarantees:**
  4. `(ball.position = 10) -> F (ball.moveLeft)`: If the ball is at the rightmost wall, it must eventually move left.
  5. `(ball.position = 0) -> F (ball.moveRight)`: If the ball is at the leftmost wall, it must eventually move right.
  6. `(!(ball.position = 0 || ball.position = 10)) -> F (ball.moveLeft || ball.moveRight)`: If the ball is neither at the leftmost nor at the rightmost wall, it must eventually move either left or right.
  7. `(ball.position = 0 && X !(ball.moveLeft)) -> G (!(ball.moveLeft) W (ball.position = 10))`: If the ball is at the leftmost wall and it is not moving left in the next state, it must keep not moving left until it reaches the rightmost wall.
  8. `(ball.position = 10 && X !(ball.moveRight)) -> G (!(ball.moveRight) W (ball.position = 0))`: If the ball is at the rightmost wall and it is not moving right in the next state, it must keep not moving right until it reaches the leftmost wall.
