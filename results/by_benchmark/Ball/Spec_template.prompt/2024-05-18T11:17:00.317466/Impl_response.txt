To implement the described functions and predicates for a system that controls the movement of a ball within boundaries, we can start by defining the JavaScript functions as given. Since the environment details (like the system API specifics) are not fully described, I'll provide a basic mock-up for these functionalities which you can adapt based on your specific environment API.

### 1. Functions:
- `moveLeft(ball)`: This function will set the ball's signal to indicate movement to the left.
- `moveRight(ball)`: This function will set the ball's signal to indicate movement to the right.

### 2. Predicates:
- `leftmost(ball)`: This predicate checks if the ball is at the leftmost boundary.
- `rightmost(ball)`: This predicate checks if the ball is at the rightmost boundary.

Here's how you might define these in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Assuming `ball` is an object that can have properties `position` and `signal`.
// Let's also assume a fixed range for the movement of the ball, e.g., between positions 0 (leftmost) to 10 (rightmost).

// Functions:
function moveLeft(ball) {
    // Check if not already at the leftmost wall
    if (ball.position > 0) {
        ball.position -= 1; // Move left
        ball.signal = 'left'; // Set signal to indicate left movement
    }
    return ball.signal;
}

function moveRight(ball) {
    // Check if not already at the rightmost wall
    if (ball.position < 10) {
        ball.position += 1; // Move right
        ball.signal = 'right'; // Set signal to indicate right movement
    }
    return ball.signal;
}

// Predicates:
function leftmost(ball) {
    return ball.position === 0; // Returns true if ball is at the leftmost position
}

function rightmost(ball) {
    return ball.position === 10; // Returns true if ball is at the rightmost position
}

// Usage example:
let ball = { position: 5, signal: '' };

console.log(moveLeft(ball));     // Move ball to the left
console.log(ball);               // Check new state of the ball

console.log(leftmost(ball));     // Check if ball is at the leftmost position
console.log(rightmost(ball));    // Check if ball is at the rightmost position

// Continue moving left and check positions
console.log(moveLeft(ball));
console.log(leftmost(ball));
```

### Notes:
- This mockup assumes the `ball` object contains a `position` to track the current position of the ball.
- The `moveLeft` and `moveRight` functions adjust the position of the ball and set an appropriate signal.
- The `leftmost` and `rightmost` predicates simply check the current position against predefined boundary positions (0 and 10 in this case).
- You may need to adjust the logic and the structure of the `ball` object based on actual capabilities and constraints of your system API.
- Ensure proper error handling and validations as needed in a real-world application.
