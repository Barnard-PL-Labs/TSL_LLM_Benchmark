To implement the required functions and predicates in JavaScript for controlling a ball within a bounded area, we start by assuming the cell "ball" holds information about the ball's position. We'll define it such that the position is represented by an integer indicating its horizontal placement.

Here is the JavaScript implementation:

```javascript
// Initial setup for the ball position
// Assuming the ball can move between positions 0 (leftmost) to 10 (rightmost)
let ball = {
  position: 5 // middle of the range
};

// Functions
function moveLeft(ball) {
  if (ball.position > 0) { // Check if the ball is not already at the leftmost position
    ball.position--;
  }
  return `Moved to ${ball.position}`; // Returns a signal (log) that the ball moved left
}

function moveRight(ball) {
  if (ball.position < 10) { // Check if the ball is not already at the rightmost position
    ball.position++;
  }
  return `Moved to ${ball.position}`; // Returns a signal (log) that the ball moved right
}

// Predicates
function leftmost(ball) {
  return ball.position === 0; // Returns true if the ball is at the leftmost position
}

function rightmost(ball) {
  return ball.position === 10; // Returns true if the ball is at the rightmost position
}

// Usage example: Demonstrating the functions and predicates
console.log(moveLeft(ball));  // Attempt to move ball left
console.log(moveRight(ball)); // Attempt to move ball right
console.log(`Is the ball at the leftmost position? ${leftmost(ball)}`);   // Should return false if not at position 0
console.log(`Is the ball at the rightmost position? ${rightmost(ball)}`); // Should return false if not at position 10
```

### Explanation:

1. **Ball Object:** We define an object `ball` that keeps track of the ball's position. It starts at position 5 for this example.

2. **moveLeft and moveRight Functions:** These functions check the boundary conditions (leftmost and rightmost limits) before changing the position of the ball. They also return a message indicating the new position of the ball.

3. **leftmost and rightmost Predicates:** These functions check if the ball is at the extreme left or right positions and return a Boolean value accordingly.

The code above would be run in a Node.js environment or inside a browser's developer console, with modifications required depending on the actual system APIs and environment where the `ball` object is maintained.
