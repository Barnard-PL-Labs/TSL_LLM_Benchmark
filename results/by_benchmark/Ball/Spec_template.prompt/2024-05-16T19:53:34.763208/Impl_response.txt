Given the requirements, I'll provide JavaScript implementations for the functions and predicates that interact with the `ball` cell. Since there's no specific API structure provided, these functions will act based on assumed behavior for interacting with `ball`.

### Functions to Move the Ball
```javascript
/**
 * Moves the ball to the left by sending an appropriate signal.
 * This function assumes the existence of a method to update the ball's position.
 * @param {Object} ball - The ball object or reference.
 * @returns {void}
 */
function moveLeft(ball) {
    // Assuming 'ball' has a method to update its position.
    ball.updatePosition('left');
}

/**
 * Moves the ball to the right by sending an appropriate signal.
 * This function assumes the existence of a method to update the ball's position.
 * @param {Object} ball - The ball object or reference.
 * @returns {void}
 */
function moveRight(ball) {
    // Assuming 'ball' has a method to update its position.
    ball.updatePosition('right');
}
```

### Predicates to Check Ball Position
```javascript
/**
 * Checks if the ball is at the leftmost position.
 * @param {Object} ball - The ball object or reference.
 * @returns {boolean} - Returns true if the ball is at the leftmost position.
 */
function leftmost(ball) {
    // Assuming 'ball' has a property that marks its position or a method to check it.
    return ball.position === 0;  // Assuming '0' is the leftmost position.
}

/**
 * Checks if the ball is at the rightmost position.
 * @param {Object} ball - The ball object or reference.
 * @returns {boolean} - Returns true if the ball is at the rightmost position.
 */
function rightmost(ball) {
    // Assuming 'ball' has a property for its position or a method to check it.
    return ball.position === ball.maxPosition;  // Assuming 'maxPosition' is the rightmost boundary.
}
```

### Note:
- The implementations of `moveLeft`, `moveRight`, `leftmost`, and `rightmost` are based on assumptions about how `ball` can be manipulated or queried because there's no detailed API wrapper provided.
- Adjust `ball.position` and `ball.maxPosition` according to the actual properties or methods available in your specific `ball` object or the system environment.
- If the ball object has different methods or properties for managing positions, update the function calls and property checks accordingly in the code above.
