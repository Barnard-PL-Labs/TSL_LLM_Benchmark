To implement the specified functions and predicates for the ball movement system in JavaScript, we can start by assuming some basic behavior and structure of our environment and the `ball` object. Since the exact details of the API or the environment setup are not provided, we'll create a simple conceptual example.

1. **Functions**: These will manipulate or provide directives based on the state of the ball.
2. **Predicates**: These will check certain conditions about the ball's position and return boolean values.

Here is how you might implement these functions and predicates:

```javascript
// Assuming 'ball' is an object that has a 'position' property
// For simplicity, let's consider 'position' is a numerical value indicating its position on a line.

// Function to move the ball to the left
function moveLeft(ball) {
    if (!leftmost(ball)) { // check if not at the leftmost position
        ball.position -= 1; // move left by decreasing the position value
    }
    return `Signal to move left sent for position ${ball.position}`;
}

// Function to move the ball to the right
function moveRight(ball) {
    if (!rightmost(ball)) { // check if not at the rightmost position
        ball.position += 1; // move right by increasing the position value
    }
    return `Signal to move right sent for position ${ball.position}`;
}

// Predicate to check if the ball is at the leftmost position
function leftmost(ball) {
    return ball.position === 0; // assuming 0 as the leftmost position
}

// Predicate to check if the ball is at the rightmost position
function rightmost(ball) {
    const rightmostPosition = 10; // assuming 10 as the rightmost position for this example
    return ball.position === rightmostPosition;
}

// Example usage:
let ball = { position: 5 }; // Starting position of the ball

console.log(moveLeft(ball));  // Move ball to the left
console.log(moveRight(ball)); // Try moving right
console.log("Is ball at leftmost position?", leftmost(ball));
console.log("Is ball at rightmost position?", rightmost(ball));
```

### Notes:
- **Positioning System**: The ball's position is a simple integer. Movement left and right translates to decrementing and incrementing this position, respectively.
- **Boundary Conditions**: `leftmost` and `rightmost` are predicates checking if the ball is at the boundaries of its allowed range, which we assumed as 0 for the leftmost and 10 for the rightmost.
- **Error Handling**: This implementation assumes the ball object is always valid and that it always has a 'position' property. In a real implementation, you might want to add checks or error handling to ensure the object passed to each function is valid.

This is a basic conceptual demonstration and would need adjustments based on the specifics of the real system API and environment.
