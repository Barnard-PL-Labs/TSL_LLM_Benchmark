Here is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // If the ball is moved to the left, then it is not at the rightmost wall in the next moment
  ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)] -> X !(rightmost(ball)));

  // If the ball is moved to the right, then it is not at the leftmost wall in the next moment
  ([ball <- moveRight(ball)] -> X !(leftmost(ball)));

  // The ball cannot be at both the leftmost and the rightmost wall at the same time
  !(leftmost(ball) && rightmost(ball));
}

always guarantee {
  // If the ball is at the rightmost wall, eventually it must be moved to the left
  rightmost(ball) -> F ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)]);

  // If the ball is at the leftmost wall, eventually it must be moved to the right
  leftmost(ball) -> F ([ball <- moveRight(ball)]);

  // If the ball is neither at the leftmost nor at the rightmost wall, then eventually, it must be moved either to the left or to the right
  !(leftmost(ball) || rightmost(ball)) -> F ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)] || [ball <- moveRight(ball)]);

  // If the ball is at the leftmost wall and is going to move away from it in the next moment, it must continue not moving to the left until it reaches the rightmost wall
  (leftmost(ball) && X ([ball <- moveRight(ball)])) -> ([ball <- moveRight(ball)] W rightmost(ball));

  // If the ball is at the rightmost wall and is going to move away from it in the next moment, it must continue not moving to the right until it reaches the leftmost wall
  (rightmost(ball) && X ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)])) -> ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)] W leftmost(ball));
}
```

This TSL code covers all of the scenarios detailed in the natural language description, translating the rules and behaviors of the ball's movement between two wall positions into formal temporal logic constraints.
