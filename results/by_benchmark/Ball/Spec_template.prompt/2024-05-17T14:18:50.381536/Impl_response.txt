The JavaScript implementations for the defined functions and predicates, based on the description of the environment and the cells, are as follows. Since there isn't much detail on how the `ball` cell interacts with the environment or how its state is represented and modified, we'll assume some hypothetical interactions:

### Functions
The `moveLeft` and `moveRight` functions might adjust a numerical value that represents the position of the ball on a horizontal line, decreasing or increasing it respectively.

```javascript
function moveLeft(ball) {
  // Assuming 'ball.position' keeps track of the ball's horizontal position
  // This function decrements the position to move the ball left
  ball.position--;
  return `Signal to move ball to position ${ball.position}`;
}

function moveRight(ball) {
  // Similar to 'moveLeft', but increments the position to move the ball right
  ball.position++;
  return `Signal to move ball to position ${ball.position}`;
}
```

### Predicates
The `leftmost` and `rightmost` predicates might check if the ball's position is at predefined limits, which we assume are constants.

```javascript
// Define constants for the boundaries of the ball's movement
const LEFT_WALL = 0;
const RIGHT_WALL = 10;  // Assuming the rightmost wall is at position 10

function leftmost(ball) {
  // Check if the ball's current position is equal to the leftmost wall
  return ball.position === LEFT_WALL;
}

function rightmost(ball) {
  // Check if the ball's current position is equal to the rightmost wall
  return ball.position === RIGHT_WALL;
}
```

### Set Up the Ball Object
For the above functions and predicates to work, you'll need an object to represent the ball's current state. Here's a simple example of how you might set this up:

```javascript
let ball = {
  position: 5  // Start the ball at the middle of the field
};

// Example Usage
console.log(moveLeft(ball));  // Moves the ball to the left
console.log(moveRight(ball)); // Moves the ball to the right
console.log(leftmost(ball));  // Checks if the ball is at the leftmost position
console.log(rightmost(ball)); // Checks if the ball is at the rightmost position
```

This example assumes a very simplified model of interaction where the ball's position is a single integer value. Depending on the actual complexity and requirements of your environment, you might need to adjust these functions to interact with a more sophisticated API or system.
