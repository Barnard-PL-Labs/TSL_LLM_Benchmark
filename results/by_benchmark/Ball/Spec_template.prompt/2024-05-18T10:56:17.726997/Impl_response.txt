Given the description, I'll provide JavaScript implementations for the specified functions and predicates related to the cell "ball". These will handle the signal states based on the movement and position of the ball:

```javascript
/**
 * Function to move the ball to the left.
 * @param {Object} ball - A cell representing the ball.
 * @returns {Object} - A signal for moving the ball to the left.
 */
function moveLeft(ball) {
    ball.signal = 'moveLeft';
    return ball.signal;
}

/**
 * Function to move the ball to the right.
 * @param {Object} ball - A cell representing the ball.
 * @returns {Object} - A signal for moving the ball to the right.
 */
function moveRight(ball) {
    ball.signal = 'moveRight';
    return ball.signal;
}

/**
 * Predicate to check if the ball is against the leftmost wall.
 * @param {Object} ball - A cell representing the ball.
 * @returns {boolean} - True if the ball is against the leftmost wall, false otherwise.
 */
function leftmost(ball) {
    return ball.position === 'leftmost';
}

/**
 * Predicate to check if the ball is against the rightmost wall.
 * @param {Object} ball - A cell representing the ball.
 * @returns {boolean} - True if the ball is against the rightmost wall, false otherwise.
 */
function rightmost(ball) {
    return ball.position === 'rightmost';
}
```

### Additional Explanation:

1. **moveLeft and moveRight Functions:** 
   - These functions take a `ball` object as an argument which represents the state of the ball.
   - They modify the `signal` property of the ball to either 'moveLeft' or 'moveRight' respectively, which could be hypothetical signals to some underlying system controller that directs the ball's movement.

2. **leftmost and rightmost Predicates:**
   - These are functions designed to evaluate whether the ball is at the leftmost or rightmost position respectively.
   - They check the `position` attribute of the `ball` object. This attribute should contain the current position of the ball relative to predefined boundaries ('leftmost' or 'rightmost').
   - They return a boolean value based on the condition being met.

### Notes:
- The code assumes that the `ball` object has properties like `signal` and `position` that are appropriately managed and updated elsewhere in your system.
- In a real-world application, you'd need to ensure that the structure and management of the `ball` object are consistent with how the API and the rest of your system are designed.
- Depending on the actual system implementation, you might need to integrate event listeners, state management or other mechanisms to respond to changes in the ball's state or position effectively.
