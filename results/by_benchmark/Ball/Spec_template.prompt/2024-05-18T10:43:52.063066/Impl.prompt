A system environment has the following API. Using the API, implement the following methods in JavaScript. The methods are divided into two categories, "functions" and "predicates". "functions" can be arbitrary functions, but "predicates" always return a boolean.

Functions and predicates to implement:


Cells:
  "ball" is a cell that represents the state of the signal that determines how the ball should move
Functions:
  moveLeft(ball) => returns a signal to move the ball to the left
  moveRight(ball) => returns a signal to move the ball to the right
Predicates:
  leftmost(ball) => is the ball against the leftmost wall?
  rightmost(ball) => is the ball against the rightmost wall?
