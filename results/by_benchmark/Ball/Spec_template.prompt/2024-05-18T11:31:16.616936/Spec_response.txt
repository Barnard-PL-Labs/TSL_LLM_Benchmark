Here's the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // If the ball is moved to the left, then in the next moment, it is guaranteed that the ball is not at the rightmost wall.
  ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)]) -> X !(rightmost(ball));

  // If the ball is moved to the right, then in the next moment, it is ensured that the ball is not at the leftmost wall.
  ([ball <- moveRight(ball)]) -> X !(leftmost(ball));

  // It is always the case that the ball cannot be at both the leftmost and the rightmost wall at the same time.
  !(leftmost(ball) && rightmost(ball));
}

always guarantee {
  // If the ball is at the rightmost wall, eventually it must be moved to the left.
  rightmost(ball) -> F ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)]);

  // If the ball is at the leftmost wall, eventually it must be moved to the right.
  leftmost(ball) -> F ([ball <- moveRight(ball)]);

  // If the ball is neither at the leftmost nor at the rightmost wall, then eventually, it must be moved either to the left or to the right.
  !(leftmost(ball) || rightmost(ball)) -> F ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)] || [ball <- moveRight(ball)]);

  // If the ball is at the leftmost wall and is going to move away from it in the next moment, it must continue not moving to the left until it reaches the rightmost wall.
  leftmost(ball) && X ([ball <- moveRight(ball)]) -> ([ball <- moveRight(ball)] W rightmost(ball));

  // If the ball is at the rightmost wall and is going to move away from it in the next moment, it must continue not moving to the right until it reaches the leftmost wall.
  rightmost(ball) && X ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)]) -> ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)] W leftmost(ball));
}
```

This TSL specification captures the bouncing behavior of the ball between two walls, ensuring that the ball moves in a manner consistent with the constraints given in the natural language description. The "assume" section ensures that the ball movement respects the boundaries of the space, while the "guarantee" section enforces that the ball continues to move back and forth between the walls as expected.
