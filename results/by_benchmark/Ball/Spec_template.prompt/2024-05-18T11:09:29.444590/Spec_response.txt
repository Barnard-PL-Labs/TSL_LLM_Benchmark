Here is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description and the functions and predicates for the ball movement scenario:

```tsl
always assume {
  // If the ball is moved to the left, then in the next moment, it is not at the rightmost wall.
  ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)] -> X !(rightmost(ball)));

  // If the ball is moved to the right, then in the next moment, it is not at the leftmost wall.
  ([ball <- moveRight(ball)] -> X !(leftmost(ball)));

  // It is always the case that the ball cannot be at both the leftmost and the rightmost wall at the same time.
  !(leftmost(ball) && rightmost(ball));
}

always guarantee {
  // If the ball is at the rightmost wall, eventually it must be moved to the left.
  rightmost(ball) -> F ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)]);

  // If the ball is at the leftmost wall, eventually it must be moved to the right.
  leftmost(ball) -> F ([ball <- moveRight(ball)]);

  // If the ball is neither at the leftmost nor at the rightmost wall, then eventually, it must be moved either to the left or to the right.
  !(leftmost(ball) || rightmost(ball)) -> F ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)] || [ball <- moveRight(ball)]);

  // If the ball is at the leftmost wall and is going to move away from it in the next moment, it must continue not moving to the left until it reaches the rightmost wall.
  (leftmost(ball) && X ([ball <- moveRight(ball)])) -> G ([ball <- moveRight(ball)] W rightmost(ball));

  // If the ball is at the rightmost wall and is going to move away from it in the next moment, it must continue not moving to the right until it reaches the leftmost wall.
  (rightmost(ball) && X ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)])) -> G ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)] W leftmost(ball));
}
```

This TSL specification captures the dynamics of a ball bouncing between two walls, ensuring that the ball moves appropriately within the defined constraints and responds correctly based on its position. The assumptions ensure the logical constraints on movement and wall positions, while the guarantees enforce the required behavior depending on the ball's position.
