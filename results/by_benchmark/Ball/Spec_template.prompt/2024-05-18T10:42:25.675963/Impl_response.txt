To implement the specified functions and predicates in JavaScript for manipulating and checking the position of a "ball" in a system, follow these guidelines and examples below. Since the exact nature of the "ball" cell and how it interacts with the system API isn't fully detailed, I will provide a generalized approach that should be adapted based on your system's specific API details and data structures.

### JavaScript Code Implementation

First, define the functions `moveLeft` and `moveRight` that modify the state of the ball to represent movement. Next, define the predicates `leftmost` and `rightmost` to check if the ball is at either extreme of its allowable movement area.

```javascript
// Assuming 'ball' is an object that can be manipulated directly:
// For example, ball might look something like this: { position: 0, minPosition: 0, maxPosition: 10 }

/**
 * Moves the ball to the left by updating its position state.
 * @param {object} ball - The ball object with its current state.
 * @returns {object} The updated ball object after moving left.
 */
function moveLeft(ball) {
    // Check if the ball is not at the leftmost position
    if (ball.position > ball.minPosition) {
        ball.position -= 1; // Move the ball one unit to the left
    }
    return ball; // return the updated state of the ball
}

/**
 * Moves the ball to the right by updating its position state.
 * @param {object} ball - The ball object with its current state.
 * @returns {object} The updated ball object after moving right.
 */
function moveRight(ball) {
    // Check if the ball is not at the rightmost position
    if (ball.position < ball.maxPosition) {
        ball.position += 1; // Move the ball one unit to the right
    }
    return ball; // return the updated state of the ball
}

/**
 * Checks if the ball is at the leftmost position.
 * @param {object} ball - The ball object with its current state.
 * @returns {boolean} True if the ball is at the leftmost position, false otherwise.
 */
function leftmost(ball) {
    return ball.position === ball.minPosition;
}

/**
 * Checks if the ball is at the rightmost position.
 * @param {object} ball - The ball object with its current state.
 * @returns {boolean} True if the ball is at the rightmost position, false otherwise.
 */
function rightmost(ball) {
    return ball.position === ball.maxPosition;
}

// Example usage:
let ball = { position: 5, minPosition: 0, maxPosition: 10 };
console.log('Initial Position:', ball.position);
ball = moveLeft(ball);
console.log('After Moving Left:', ball.position);
ball = moveRight(ball);
console.log('After Moving Right:', ball.position);
console.log('Is Leftmost:', leftmost(ball));
console.log('Is Rightmost:', rightmost(ball));
```

### Notes

1. **Adaptation**: The actual implementation of `ball`, movement methods, and position checks might need to be adapted based on how your system represents and updates the state of objects. If the `ball` is not an object or its state is managed differently (e.g., through a database or a state management library), you would need to adjust the methods accordingly.

2. **Error Handling**: Consider adding error handling or more robust boundary checks depending on the system requirements and how dynamic the movement boundaries (`minPosition` and `maxPosition`) are.

3. **Testing**: Ensure to thoroughly test these functions and predicates with various states of the `ball` object to confirm they handle all edge cases as expected.
