To create the requested JavaScript functions and predicates based on the provided environment API, we'll assume the following:

1. The `ball` variable refers to an object or a state that can be manipulated through signal passing.
2. Functions `moveLeft(ball)` and `moveRight(ball)` produce a signal instead of directly modifying the `ball`.
3. Predicates `leftmost(ball)` and `rightmost(ball)` evaluate to boolean values indicating the position of the ball relative to boundaries.

Here's how you might implement these in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Functions
function moveLeft(ball) {
    // Assuming we communicate with the ball through a method `sendSignal`
    // This function returns a signal, which we'll represent as a string or object
    return { action: 'move', direction: 'left', target: ball };
}

function moveRight(ball) {
    // Similar to moveLeft but sends a signal to move the ball to the right
    return { action: 'move', direction: 'right', target: ball };
}

// Predicates
function leftmost(ball) {
    // Assuming `ball` has properties that define its position
    // and a method to check if it's at the leftmost position
    // For example, we assume ball.position can be 'leftmost'
    return ball.position === 'leftmost';
}

function rightmost(ball) {
    // Similar to leftmost, checks if the ball is at the rightmost position
    return ball.position === 'rightmost';
}

/* Usage Examples */

// Sample ball object
let ball = {
    position: 'center', // other potential values: 'leftmost', 'rightmost'
    sendSignal: function(signal) {
        console.log(`Signal sent to move ${signal.direction}`);
        this.position = signal.direction === 'left' ? 'leftmost' : 'rightmost'; // simplistic position update
    }
};

// Move the ball left
let leftSignal = moveLeft(ball);
ball.sendSignal(leftSignal);

// Check if the ball is at the leftmost position
if (leftmost(ball)) {
    console.log("The ball is at the leftmost position.");
}

// Move the ball right
let rightSignal = moveRight(ball);
ball.sendSignal(rightSignal);

// Check if the ball is at the rightmost position
if (rightmost(ball)) {
    console.log("The ball is at the rightmost position.");
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Functions (`moveLeft`, `moveRight`)**: These functions return a signal in the form of an object, which includes the action type, direction, and target. This is a common way to handle actions in systems where direct state manipulation isn't allowed or possible from the current context.

- **Predicates (`leftmost`, `rightmost`)**: These functions check if the `ball` is in the specified position by comparing a property of `ball`. This assumes that the ball's position is being tracked and exposed through its `position` property.

This code structure is flexible and can be adapted to different implementations of the ball object and the system API methods. The actual implementation might depend on specific details of the system API which haven't been provided here.
