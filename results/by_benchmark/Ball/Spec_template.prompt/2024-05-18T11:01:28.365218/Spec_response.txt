```tsl
always assume {
  ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)] -> X !rightmost(ball));
  ([ball <- moveRight(ball)] -> X !leftmost(ball));
  !(leftmost(ball) && rightmost(ball));
}

always guarantee {
  rightmost(ball) -> F ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)]);
  leftmost(ball) -> F ([ball <- moveRight(ball)]);
  !(leftmost(ball) || rightmost(ball)) -> F ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)] || [ball <- moveRight(ball)]);
  (leftmost(ball) && X ([ball <- moveRight(ball)])) -> (!leftmost(ball) W rightmost(ball));
  (rightmost(ball) && X ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)])) -> (!rightmost(ball) W leftmost(ball));
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Assumptions**:
  1. Moving the ball to the left ensures that in the next moment, the ball is not at the rightmost wall.
  2. When the ball is moved to the right, it ensures that in the next moment, the ball is not at the leftmost wall.
  3. The ball cannot simultaneously be at both the leftmost and rightmost walls.

- **Guarantees**:
  4. If the ball is at the rightmost wall, it must eventually be commanded to move left.
  5. If the ball is at the leftmost wall, it must eventually be commanded to move right.
  6. If the ball is neither at the leftmost nor the rightmost wall, it must eventually be commanded to move either left or right.
  7. If the ball is at the leftmost wall and begins moving right, it should continue moving in a direction that is not left until it reaches the rightmost wall.
  8. If the ball is at the rightmost wall and begins moving left, it should continue moving in a direction that is not right until it reaches the leftmost wall.
