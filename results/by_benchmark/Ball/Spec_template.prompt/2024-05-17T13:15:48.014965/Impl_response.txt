Based on your description, here's a JavaScript implementation for the functions and predicates you've described. This assumes there's a hypothetical API for managing a "ball" object, which can move left or right and can detect its position relative to the leftmost and rightmost walls. 

These implementations typically involve setting or checking the state of the "ball" cell. We'll use basic assumptions about how these might be implemented without a specific API detail.

```javascript
// Functions to move the ball
function moveLeft(ball) {
    // Assuming 'ball' is an object and it has a method to update its horizontal position (x)
    if (!leftmost(ball)) {
        ball.x -= 1; // Move ball one unit to the left
    }
    return ball; // Return updated state of the ball
}

function moveRight(ball) {
    // Assuming 'ball' is an object and it has a method to update its horizontal position (x)
    if (!rightmost(ball)) {
        ball.x += 1; // Move ball one unit to the right
    }
    return ball; // Return updated state of the ball
}

// Predicates to check if the ball is at the leftmost or rightmost position
function leftmost(ball) {
    // Assuming there's a predefined boundary condition for the leftmost wall
    return ball.x === 0; // Check if ball's x position is at the leftmost wall
}

function rightmost(ball) {
    // Assuming there's a predefined boundary condition for the rightmost wall
    // Assume 'maxX' is the maximum x position (rightmost)
    const maxX = 10; // Example maximum right limit
    return ball.x === maxX; // Check if ball's x position is at the rightmost wall
}
```

### Notes:
1. **Move Functions**: `moveLeft` and `moveRight` check whether the ball is not already at the respective boundary before moving it. This prevents the ball from moving beyond the game area.
2. **Predicate Functions**: `leftmost` and `rightmost` simply return true or false based on whether the ball's current position matches the boundary conditions.
3. **Boundary Assumptions**: This example assumes that the x-coordinate for the leftmost position is `0` and a hypothetical `10` for the rightmost. Adjust these values according to your actual environment constraints.

### Usage:
You can test these functions with a sample `ball` object like this:
```javascript
let ball = { x: 5 }; // Initial position of the ball is not at either boundary

console.log("Initial Position:", ball.x);
ball = moveLeft(ball);
console.log("After moving left:", ball.x);

if (leftmost(ball)) {
    console.log("The ball is at the leftmost position.");
}

ball = moveRight(ball);
console.log("After moving right:", ball.x);
ball = moveRight(ball);
console.log("After moving right again:", ball.x);

if (rightmost(ball)) {
    console.log("The ball is at the rightmost position.");
}
```

This will simulate the ball moving left and then twice to the right, checking its boundary conditions after each move. Adjust the logic and parameters to fit the specifics of your environment API and requirements.
