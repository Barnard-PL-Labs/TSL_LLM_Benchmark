To implement the described functions and predicates using JavaScript, we can assume that the "ball" is an object that holds properties about its position and possibly methods to control its movement. Since these methods would operate on signals, we'll define simple JavaScript functions for `moveLeft`, `moveRight`, and predicates `leftmost`, `rightmost`.

Here's how you might implement these given the API:

### Definitions & Assumptions:
1. Assuming the ball's position is kept track of using a coordinate system with a `position` property.
2. `leftmost` and `rightmost` are based on fixed limits of the playing field or area (`LEFT_WALL` and `RIGHT_WALL`).
3. The `ball` object might look like `{ position: 0 }`.

### JavaScript Implementation:

```javascript
const LEFT_WALL = 0; // Assuming 0 is the minimum x-coordinate (leftmost)
const RIGHT_WALL = 100; // Assuming 100 is the maximum x-coordinate (rightmost)

class Ball {
    constructor() {
        this.position = 50; // Start in the middle of the field
    }
    
    moveLeft() {
        // Move the ball to the left by decreasing its position
        if (this.position > LEFT_WALL) {
            this.position -= 1;
        }
        return this.position;
    }
    
    moveRight() {
        // Move the ball to the right by increasing its position
        if (this.position < RIGHT_WALL) {
            this.position += 1;
        }
        return this.position;
    }
    
    leftmost() {
        // Check if the ball is at the leftmost wall
        return this.position === LEFT_WALL;
    }
    
    rightmost() {
        // Check if the ball is at the rightmost wall
        return this.position === RIGHT_WALL;
    }
}

// Usage
let ball = new Ball();

// Moving the ball around:
console.log(`Initial position: ${ball.position}`);
console.log(`Moving left: ${ball.moveLeft()}`);
console.log(`Is leftmost? ${ball.leftmost()}`);
console.log(`Moving right: ${ball.moveRight()}`);
console.log(`Is rightmost? ${ball.rightmost()}`);

// You would call these methods to interact with the ball based on game logic or user inputs
```

### Explanation:

- `moveLeft` and `moveRight` methods adjust the `position` of the `ball`. They check boundaries to ensure the ball doesn't go beyond the defined limits (`LEFT_WALL` and `RIGHT_WALL`).
- `leftmost` and `rightmost` methods check if the ball is at the respective boundaries.
  
This structure allows the ball to be manipulated within predefined constraints, which would be particularly useful in a game or simulation environment. The checks ensure that the ball doesn't move beyond the playable area, and the methods could be easily adapted or expanded for additional functionality, such as diagonal movement or increased movement speed.
