Here is the TSL specification based on your description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // If the ball is moved to the left, in the next moment it cannot be at the rightmost wall.
  ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)]) -> X !(rightmost(ball));
  
  // If the ball is moved to the right, in the next moment it cannot be at the leftmost wall.
  ([ball <- moveRight(ball)]) -> X !(leftmost(ball));
  
  // The ball cannot be at both the leftmost and rightmost wall at the same time.
  !(leftmost(ball) && rightmost(ball));
}

always guarantee {
  // If the ball is at the rightmost wall, eventually it must be moved to the left.
  rightmost(ball) -> F ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)]);
  
  // If the ball is at the leftmost wall, eventually it must be moved to the right.
  leftmost(ball) -> F ([ball <- moveRight(ball)]);
  
  // If the ball is neither at the leftmost nor at the rightmost wall, then eventually, it must be moved either to the left or to the right.
  !(leftmost(ball) || rightmost(ball)) -> F ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)] || [ball <- moveRight(ball)]);
  
  // If the ball is at the leftmost wall and is going to move away from it in the next moment, it must continue not moving to the left until it reaches the rightmost wall.
  (leftmost(ball) && X ([ball <- moveRight(ball)])) -> (!leftmost(ball) W rightmost(ball));
  
  // If the ball is at the rightmost wall and is going to move away from it in the next moment, it must continue not moving to the right until it reaches the leftmost wall.
  (rightmost(ball) && X ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)])) -> (!rightmost(ball) W leftmost(ball));
}
```

This TSL specification captures all the assumptions and guarantees described in your natural language description for the movement of a ball bouncing between two walls. The `always assume` block ensures that the movement actions have logical consequences in terms of wall proximity in the next state, while the `always guarantee` block manages the required movement based on the ball's position relative to the walls.
