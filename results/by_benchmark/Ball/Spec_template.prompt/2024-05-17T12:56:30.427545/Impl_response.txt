To implement the functions and predicates required for controlling a ball in a system environment as described, we can use JavaScript. Below are the implementations for each of the functions and predicates for the "ball" cell. Since the specifics of how the "ball" is represented (such as its properties and how it interacts with the environment) are not detailed, these implementations will assume a simple model where the ball's position is stored and updated within a global object or directly in functions.

### Functions Implementation

1. **moveLeft(ball)**
   - This function will adjust the ball's position to simulate a movement to the left. Assuming `ball` has a property `x` representing its horizontal position:

```javascript
function moveLeft(ball) {
    // Decrease the x position of the ball to move it left
    if (!leftmost(ball)) {
        ball.x -= 1;
    }
    return `Signal to move ${ball.id} to the left`;
}
```

2. **moveRight(ball)**
   - This function will adjust the ball's position to simulate a movement to the right:

```javascript
function moveRight(ball) {
    // Increase the x position of the ball to move it right
    if (!rightmost(ball)) {
        ball.x += 1;
    }
    return `Signal to move ${ball.id} to the right`;
}
```

### Predicates Implementation

1. **leftmost(ball)**
   - This predicate checks if the ball is against the leftmost wall. Assuming there's a predefined minimum x-coordinate `MIN_X`:

```javascript
const MIN_X = 0; // Assuming the leftmost wall is at position 0

function leftmost(ball) {
    // Check if the ball's x position is at the minimum x-coordinate
    return ball.x === MIN_X;
}
```

2. **rightmost(ball)**
   - This predicate checks if the ball is against the rightmost wall. Assuming there's a predefined maximum x-coordinate `MAX_X`:

```javascript
const MAX_X = 10; // Example maximum x-coordinate

function rightmost(ball) {
    // Check if the ball's x position is at the maximum x-coordinate
    return ball.x === MAX_X;
}
```

### Example Usage

To use these functions and predicates, you would first create a ball object and then call these functions as needed:

```javascript
let ball = {id: "ball1", x: 5}; // A ball object in the middle of a 10-unit wide field

console.log(moveLeft(ball));  // Move the ball left
console.log(leftmost(ball));  // Check if the ball is at the leftmost position

console.log(moveRight(ball)); // Move the ball right
console.log(rightmost(ball)); // Check if the ball is at the rightmost position
```

This simplistic implementation assumes direct manipulation of an object's properties to simulate environmental interactions. In a practical scenario, especially within a more complex or real-time system, these functions might integrate with more sophisticated APIs or system calls to handle physics and rendering.
