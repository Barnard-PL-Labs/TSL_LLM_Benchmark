To implement the specified functions and predicates using JavaScript, we will assume that the "ball" cell represents some kind of game object or graphical element that can be manipulated programmatically. Since it's not explicitly stated how this "ball" cell is structured or how it interacts with the environment (e.g., a game board or graphical canvas), I'll provide a conceptual implementation.

Here's a basic structure in JavaScript for implementing the movement functions and boundary-check predicates for a ball object. This might represent a simple implementation in a hypothetical environment:

```javascript
// Assuming 'ball' is an object with properties 'x' for horizontal position.
// Let's also assume there's a game board or environment setup that defines
// the boundaries 'MIN_X' and 'MAX_X' which are the leftmost and rightmost limits respectively.

const MIN_X = 0;  // Example: leftmost boundary
const MAX_X = 300;  // Example: rightmost boundary

// Define the function to move the ball to the left
function moveLeft(ball) {
  if (ball.x > MIN_X) {
    ball.x -= 1;  // Move the ball one unit to the left
    return true;  // Signal successful move
  }
  return false;  // Signal failure (already at leftmost position)
}

// Define the function to move the ball to the right
function moveRight(ball) {
  if (ball.x < MAX_X) {
    ball.x += 1;  // Move the ball one unit to the right
    return true;  // Signal successful move
  }
  return false;  // Signal failure (already at rightmost position)
}

// Define the predicate to check if the ball is against the leftmost wall
function leftmost(ball) {
  return ball.x === MIN_X;
}

// Define the predicate to check if the ball is against the rightmost wall
function rightmost(ball) {
  return ball.x === MAX_X;
}

// Example usage:
let ball = { x: 150 };  // Create a ball object at position x = 150

console.log("Initial position:", ball.x);
moveLeft(ball);
console.log("After moving left:", ball.x);
moveRight(ball);
console.log("After moving right:", ball.x);

console.log("Is at leftmost position?", leftmost(ball));
console.log("Is at rightmost position?", rightmost(ball));
```

### Key Points:
- The functions `moveLeft` and `moveRight` attempt to move the ball left or right by adjusting its `x` position, unless it's already at the boundary.
- The predicates `leftmost` and `rightmost` check if the `ball.x` is at the minimum or maximum boundary, respectively.
- The configuration of `MIN_X` and `MAX_X` can be adjusted based on the actual game board or environment you are working with.
- This example assumes direct manipulation of the ball object's properties. Depending on your environment, you may need methods to handle rendering or other forms of state update.

This is a simplistic model assuming direct manipulation of JavaScript objects. In a real-world application, especially games or simulations, you'd likely be interacting with a more complex API or game engine methods to manage object states and rendering.
