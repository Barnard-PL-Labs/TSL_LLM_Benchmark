Here's the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description and functions:

```tsl
always assume {
  // If the ball is moved to the left, then in the next moment, it is guaranteed that the ball is not at the rightmost wall.
  ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)]) -> X !(rightmost(ball));

  // If the ball is moved to the right, then in the next moment, it is ensured that the ball is not at the leftmost wall.
  ([ball <- moveRight(ball)]) -> X !(leftmost(ball));

  // It is always the case that the ball cannot be at both the leftmost and the rightmost wall at the same time.
  !(leftmost(ball) && rightmost(ball));
}

always guarantee {
  // If the ball is at the rightmost wall, eventually it must be moved to the left.
  rightmost(ball) -> F ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)]);

  // If the ball is at the leftmost wall, eventually it must be moved to the right.
  leftmost(ball) -> F ([ball <- moveRight(ball)]);

  // If the ball is neither at the leftmost nor at the rightmost wall, then eventually, it must be moved either to the left or to the right.
  !(leftmost(ball) || rightmost(ball)) -> F ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)] || [ball <- moveRight(ball)]);

  // If the ball is at the leftmost wall and is going to move away from it in the next moment, it must continue not moving to the left until it reaches the rightmost wall.
  leftmost(ball) && X ([ball <- moveRight(ball)]) -> ([ball <- moveRight(ball)]) W rightmost(ball);

  // If the ball is at the rightmost wall and is going to move away from it in the next moment, it must continue not moving to the right until it reaches the leftmost wall.
  rightmost(ball) && X ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)]) -> ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)]) W leftmost(ball);
}
```

### Explanation of Logic
1. **Assumptions**:
   - If the `moveLeft` function is called on the `ball`, then in the next state, the ball can't be at the rightmost wall.
   - If the `moveRight` function is called, then in the next state, the ball can't be at the leftmost wall.
   - The ball can't be at both the leftmost and rightmost walls simultaneously.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - If the ball is at the rightmost wall, the system must ensure that the ball will eventually move to the left.
   - If the ball is at the leftmost wall, it must eventually move to the right.
   - If the ball isn't at either extreme, it must eventually move in either direction.
   - If the ball intends to move right from the leftmost position, it must continue moving right until it reaches the rightmost position.
   - If the ball intends to move left from the rightmost position, it must continue moving left until it reaches the leftmost position.
