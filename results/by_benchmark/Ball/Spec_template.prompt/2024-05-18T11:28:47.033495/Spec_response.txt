```tsl
always assume {
  // If the ball is moved to the left, it is not at the rightmost wall in the next state
  ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)] -> X !rightmost(ball));

  // If the ball is moved to the right, it is not at the leftmost wall in the next state
  ([ball <- moveRight(ball)] -> X !leftmost(ball));

  // The ball cannot be at both the leftmost and the rightmost wall at the same time
  !(leftmost(ball) && rightmost(ball));
}

always guarantee {
  // If the ball is at the rightmost wall, it must eventually be moved to the left
  rightmost(ball) -> F ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)]);

  // If the ball is at the leftmost wall, it must eventually be moved to the right
  leftmost(ball) -> F ([ball <- moveRight(ball)]);

  // If the ball is neither at the leftmost nor at the rightmost wall, it must be moved either left or right eventually
  (!(leftmost(ball) || rightmost(ball))) -> F ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)] || [ball <- moveRight(ball)]);

  // If moving away from the leftmost wall, continue moving right until the rightmost wall is reached
  (leftmost(ball) && X ([ball <- moveRight(ball)])) -> ([ball <- moveRight(ball)] W rightmost(ball));

  // If moving away from the rightmost wall, continue moving left until the leftmost wall is reached
  (rightmost(ball) && X ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)])) -> ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)] W leftmost(ball));
}
```

This TSL specification captures the temporal logic of the ball bouncing between two walls, ensuring the behavior adheres to the specified rules with regards to movement restrictions and boundary conditions.
