Here is the TSL specification derived from the provided natural language description:

```tsl
always assume {
  ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)] -> X !rightmost(ball));
  ([ball <- moveRight(ball)] -> X !leftmost(ball));
  !(leftmost(ball) && rightmost(ball));
}

always guarantee {
  rightmost(ball) -> F ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)]);
  leftmost(ball) -> F ([ball <- moveRight(ball)]);
  !(leftmost(ball) || rightmost(ball)) -> F (([ball <- moveLeft(ball)] || [ball <- moveRight(ball)]));

  (leftmost(ball) && X ([ball <- moveRight(ball)])) -> G (!leftmost(ball) W rightmost(ball));
  (rightmost(ball) && X ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)])) -> G (!rightmost(ball) W leftmost(ball));
}
```

### Explanation of the Specification

#### Assumptions:
1. If the ball moves left, in the next state, it cannot be at the rightmost wall.
2. If the ball moves right, in the next state, it cannot be at the leftmost wall.
3. The ball cannot simultaneously be at the leftmost and rightmost positions.

#### Guarantees:
4. If the ball is at the rightmost position, it must eventually move left.
5. If the ball is at the leftmost position, it must eventually move right.
6. If the ball is neither at the leftmost nor at the rightmost, it must eventually move either left or right.
7. If the ball is moving away from the leftmost position, it must continue moving right until it reaches the rightmost position.
8. If the ball is moving away from the rightmost position, it must continue moving left until it reaches the leftmost position.
