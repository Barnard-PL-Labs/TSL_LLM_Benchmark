To implement the desired functionality in JavaScript as specified, we need to create functions that work with a "ball" cell and predicates to check the position of the ball. Let's define the functions `moveLeft` and `moveRight` as well as the predicates `leftmost` and `rightmost`.

Since the inner workings of how "ball" represents its position is not detailed in the scenario, these implementations will be based on some assumptions. Here, we assume that the "ball" cell can be represented by an object with a property `position` that denotes its current position on a horizontal axis.

Here's how you could implement these in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Mock implementation of a ball object to work with the proposed functions and predicates
let ball = {
    position: 0  // position is zero-based; let's assume 0 is the leftmost, n is rightmost
};

// Function to move the ball to the left
function moveLeft(ball) {
    if (ball.position > 0) {  // Assuming there's a lower bound
        ball.position--;
    }
    return ball.position; // return the new position
}

// Function to move the ball to the right
function moveRight(ball) {
    if (ball.position < 100) {  // Assuming there's an upper bound, say at position 100
        ball.position++;
    }
    return ball.position; // return the new position
}

// Predicate to check if the ball is at the leftmost position
function leftmost(ball) {
    return ball.position === 0;
}

// Predicate to check if the ball is at the rightmost position
function rightmost(ball) {
    return ball.position === 100; // Assuming 100 is the rightmost position
}

// Usage example
console.log("Initial Position:", ball.position);
console.log("Moving left:", moveLeft(ball));  // Move ball to the left
console.log("Is Leftmost:", leftmost(ball));  // Check if it's at the leftmost position
console.log("Moving right:", moveRight(ball)); // Move ball to the right
console.log("Is Rightmost:", rightmost(ball)); // Check if it's at the rightmost position
```

In this implementation:
- The `moveLeft` function decreases the `position` of the ball if it's not already at the leftmost boundary (0 in this mock setup).
- The `moveRight` function increases the `position` of the ball if it's not already at the rightmost boundary (100 in this mock setup).
- The `leftmost` predicate checks if the ball's `position` is 0.
- The `rightmost` predicate checks if the ball's `position` is 100.

Adjust the specific values and logic to match the actual implementation details and constraints of your system, such as the actual range of positions the ball can occupy.
