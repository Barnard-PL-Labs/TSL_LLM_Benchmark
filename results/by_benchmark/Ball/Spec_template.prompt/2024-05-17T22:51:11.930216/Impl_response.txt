To implement the described methods in JavaScript for the given system environment, you can define the functions and predicates as follows. Since there is no specific API wrapper provided, the implementations will be based upon general assumptions about how the cells and signals might be handled in JavaScript.

Let's define the functions and predicates:

```javascript
/**
 * Functions to control the movement of the ball
 */

/**
 * Moves the ball to the left by sending an appropriate signal.
 * @param {Object} ball - The cell representing the ball
 * @returns {String} - Signal to move the ball left
 */
function moveLeft(ball) {
    // Assuming we send a signal as a string to move the ball
    return 'move_left';
}

/**
 * Moves the ball to the right by sending an appropriate signal.
 * @param {Object} ball - The cell representing the ball
 * @returns {String} - Signal to move the ball right
 */
function moveRight(ball) {
    // Assuming we send a signal as a string to move the ball
    return 'move_right';
}

/**
 * Predicates to determine the position of the ball
 */

/**
 * Checks if the ball is against the leftmost wall.
 * @param {Object} ball - The cell representing the ball
 * @returns {boolean} - True if the ball is at the leftmost position, otherwise false
 */
function leftmost(ball) {
    // Assume there's a property that indicates the position of the ball
    // For example, ball.position.x could be 0 if it's at the leftmost position
    return ball.position.x === 0;
}

/**
 * Checks if the ball is against the rightmost wall.
 * @param {Object} ball - The cell representing the ball
 * @returns {boolean} - True if the ball is at the rightmost position, otherwise false
 */
function rightmost(ball) {
    // Assume there's a property that indicates the position
    // For example, if the width of the area is known, ball.position.x could be compared to it
    // Assuming maxWidth is the width of the playable area
    return ball.position.x === maxWidth;
}
```

### Usage Example:

```javascript
// Example of creating a ball object
let ball = {
    position: {
        x: 0,
        y: 10
    }
};

const maxWidth = 100; // Assume the rightmost boundary is at x = 100

// Moving the ball
console.log(moveLeft(ball));  // Outputs: "move_left"
console.log(moveRight(ball)); // Outputs: "move_right"

// Checking positions
console.log(leftmost(ball));  // Outputs: true (since x = 0)
console.log(rightmost(ball)); // Outputs: false (since x = 0, not 100)
```

This code assumes that the `ball` object has a property `position` with sub-properties `x` and `y` to represent its location in a 2D space. Adjustments may be needed based on the actual data structure and environment specifics.
