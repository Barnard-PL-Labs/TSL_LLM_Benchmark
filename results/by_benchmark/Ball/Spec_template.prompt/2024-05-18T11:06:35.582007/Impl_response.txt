To implement the JavaScript functions and predicates as described, we'll define the functions `moveLeft`, `moveRight`, and the predicates `leftmost`, `rightmost` based on the given scenario. Since no specific API functions are provided to interact with the environment, we'll assume placeholder implementations for these interactions. You'll need to adapt these with real environment methods later.

Here's how you can implement the required functions and predicates:

```javascript
// Assuming 'ball' can be identified and manipulated by some properties or methods in your actual environment.

/**
 * Function to move the ball to the left
 * @param {object} ball - The ball object representing the state of the ball
 * @returns {string} - Signal to move the ball to the left
 */
function moveLeft(ball) {
    // Assuming 'ball' has a method or a way to set its direction; returning a signal as a string
    return 'move left';
}

/**
 * Function to move the ball to the right
 * @param {object} ball - The ball object representing the state of the ball
 * @returns {string} - Signal to move the ball to the right
 */
function moveRight(ball) {
    // Assuming 'ball' has a method or a way to set its direction; returning a signal as a string
    return 'move right';
}

/**
 * Predicate to check if the ball is at the leftmost position
 * @param {object} ball - The ball object representing the state of the ball
 * @returns {boolean} - True if the ball is against the leftmost wall, false otherwise
 */
function leftmost(ball) {
    // Assuming 'ball.position' gives us the position of the ball
    // Assuming '0' is the position of the leftmost wall
    // This condition should be adapted to match how the ball's position is actually determined in your environment
    return ball.position === 0;
}

/**
 * Predicate to check if the ball is at the rightmost position
 * @param {object} ball - The ball object representing the state of the ball
 * @returns {boolean} - True if the ball is against the rightmost wall, false otherwise
 */
function rightmost(ball) {
    // Assuming 'ball.position' gives us the position of the ball
    // Assuming '100' is the position of the rightmost wall
    // This condition should be adapted to match how the ball's position is actually determined in your environment
    return ball.position === 100;
}

// Example usage
let ball = {
    position: 0 // Assuming this is how we represent the position of the ball
};

console.log(moveLeft(ball));  // Output: 'move left'
console.log(moveRight(ball)); // Output: 'move right'
console.log(leftmost(ball));  // Output: true
console.log(rightmost(ball)); // Output: false
```

In this code:
- The `moveLeft` and `moveRight` functions return a string signal. This is a simplification and should be adjusted based on how your system actually sends commands or signals.
- The `leftmost` and `rightmost` predicates check the position of the ball against predefined boundary values (`0` for leftmost and `100` for rightmost). You'll need to replace these with the actual boundary conditions or methods used in your environment to get the position of the ball.
- The `ball` object is a placeholder and should be adapted to how the ball is represented in your actual system environment.
