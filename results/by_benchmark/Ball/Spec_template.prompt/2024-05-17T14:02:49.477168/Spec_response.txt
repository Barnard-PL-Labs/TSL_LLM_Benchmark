```
always assume {
  ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)] -> X !(rightmost(ball)));
  ([ball <- moveRight(ball)] -> X !(leftmost(ball)));
  !(leftmost(ball) && rightmost(ball));
}

always guarantee {
  rightmost(ball) -> F ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)]);
  leftmost(ball) -> F ([ball <- moveRight(ball)]);
  !(leftmost(ball) || rightmost(ball)) -> F ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)] || [ball <- moveRight(ball)]);
  (leftmost(ball) && X ([ball <- moveRight(ball)])) -> (G !(leftmost(ball)) W rightmost(ball));
  (rightmost(ball) && X ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)])) -> (G !(rightmost(ball)) W leftmost(ball));
}
```

In the TSL specification above, assumptions ensure the logical continuity of the ball's movement between walls, and guarantees dictate how the ball should move based on its current position, ensuring it bounces correctly between the two walls.
