To implement the requested functions and predicates in JavaScript based on the API and the specifications provided, we first need to clarify the operations of the "ball" cell. Since "ball" represents the state of the signal determining the ball's movement, we assume it could contain information about position or direction. The predicates will check conditions (e.g., against walls), and the functions will modify the ball's state (e.g., movement directions).

Here's how you might define these functions and predicates in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Function to move the ball to the left
function moveLeft(ball) {
    // Assuming `ball` has a property `position` which can be decremented
    ball.position -= 1;
    return ball; // Returns the updated ball state
}

// Function to move the ball to the right
function moveRight(ball) {
    // Assuming `ball` has a property `position` which can be incremented
    ball.position += 1;
    return ball; // Returns the updated ball state
}

// Predicate to check if the ball is against the leftmost wall
function leftmost(ball) {
    // Assuming there is a known minimum position value that represents the leftmost wall
    const leftmostPosition = 0; // This value would depend on your system setup
    return ball.position === leftmostPosition;
}

// Predicate to check if the ball is against the rightmost wall
function rightmost(ball) {
    // Assuming there is a known maximum position value that represents the rightmost wall
    const rightmostPosition = 10; // This value would need to be defined according to your environment
    return ball.position === rightmostPosition;
}

// Example usage:
let ball = { position: 5 }; // Initial position of the ball
console.log("Initial position: ", ball.position);
ball = moveRight(ball);
console.log("After moving right: ", ball.position);
console.log("Is rightmost? ", rightmost(ball));
ball = moveLeft(ball);
console.log("After moving left: ", ball.position);
console.log("Is leftmost? ", leftmost(ball));
```

**Notes:**
1. **Ball Object:** The `ball` object has been assumed to have a `position` property. Adjust this depending on how your API defines the "ball" state.
2. **Boundary Conditions:** The `leftmostPosition` and `rightmostPosition` are set as constants in this example. Modify them according to the actual boundaries of your system environment.
3. **Return of State:** Both movement functions return the modified `ball` object, allowing for chaining or further processing after a move.
4. **Testing and Debugging:** The example usage at the end demonstrates creating a `ball`, manipulating it, and checking boundary conditions. Use similar tests to ensure the functions align with expected behavior in your specific environment.
