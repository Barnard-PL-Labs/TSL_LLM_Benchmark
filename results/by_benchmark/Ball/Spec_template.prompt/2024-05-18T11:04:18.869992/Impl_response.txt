It appears there is some misunderstanding about the implementation of the given API in JavaScript for the specified functions and predicates. Since the exact details of the API are not provided, I will make some assumptions and provide basic JavaScript implementations based on those assumptions. The implementations will use fictitious properties and methods that you will need to adjust according to your actual API.

Here are the JavaScript functions and predicates for the `ball` cell based on the given descriptions:

### Functions:

#### Move Left
This function alters the state of the `ball` object to reflect a movement to the left. Assuming there's a method or property to change the position:

```javascript
function moveLeft(ball) {
    if (!leftmost(ball)) { // Check if it's not already at the leftmost position
        ball.position.x -= 1; // Decrease the x-coordinate to move left
    }
    return ball; // Return updated ball object (or its signal)
}
```

#### Move Right
This function alters the state of the `ball` object to reflect a movement to the right:

```javascript
function moveRight(ball) {
    if (!rightmost(ball)) { // Check if it's not already at the rightmost position
        ball.position.x += 1; // Increase the x-coordinate to move right
    }
    return ball; // Return updated ball object (or its signal)
}
```

### Predicates:

#### Leftmost
This predicate checks if the `ball` is at the leftmost position. Assuming there is a minimum x-coordinate:

```javascript
function leftmost(ball) {
    return ball.position.x === 0; // Assuming 0 is the leftmost boundary
}
```

#### Rightmost
This predicate checks if the `ball` is at the rightmost position. Assuming there is a maximum x-coordinate which you will need to define:

```javascript
const maxX = 10; // This should be set to whatever your rightmost boundary's x-coordinate is

function rightmost(ball) {
    return ball.position.x === maxX;
}
```

### Notes
1. **Adjusting to Your API:** Since the specific properties and methods of your `ball` object or the system API are not detailed, you might need to adjust the property accesses (like `ball.position.x`) to whatever is appropriate in your environment.
   
2. **Error Handling and Boundaries:** The functions assume simple error checking by not moving the ball further if it's already at the boundary. Ensure your actual API handles or needs such checks.

3. **Return Values:** Depending on how your API is designed to handle signals, you might need to modify the return statements to format the signal appropriately instead of returning the `ball` object itself.

These implementations are based on common practices and assumptions; please modify them according to the actual details of your system and API documentation.
