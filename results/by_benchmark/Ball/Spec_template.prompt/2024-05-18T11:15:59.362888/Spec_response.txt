Here is the TSL specification based on the natural language description provided for the ball bouncing between two walls:

```tsl
always assume {
  ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)] -> X !(rightmost(ball)));
  ([ball <- moveRight(ball)] -> X !(leftmost(ball)));
  !(leftmost(ball) && rightmost(ball));
}

always guarantee {
  rightmost(ball) -> F ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)]);
  leftmost(ball) -> F ([ball <- moveRight(ball)]);
  !(leftmost(ball) || rightmost(ball)) -> F (([ball <- moveLeft(ball)]) || ([ball <- moveRight(ball)]));
  (leftmost(ball) && X ([ball <- moveRight(ball)])) -> (!([ball <- moveLeft(ball)]) W rightmost(ball));
  (rightmost(ball) && X ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)])) -> (!([ball <- moveRight(ball)]) W leftmost(ball));
}
```

### Explanation:

#### Assumptions:
1. `([ball <- moveLeft(ball)] -> X !(rightmost(ball)));` - If the ball is moving to the left, then in the next state, it is not at the rightmost wall.
2. `([ball <- moveRight(ball)] -> X !(leftmost(ball)));` - If the ball is moving to the right, then in the next state, it is not at the leftmost wall.
3. `!(leftmost(ball) && rightmost(ball));` - The ball cannot be simultaneously at both the leftmost and the rightmost walls.

#### Guarantees:
4. `rightmost(ball) -> F ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)]);` - If the ball is at the rightmost wall, it must eventually move to the left.
5. `leftmost(ball) -> F ([ball <- moveRight(ball)]);` - If the ball is at the leftmost wall, it must eventually move to the right.
6. `!(leftmost(ball) || rightmost(ball)) -> F (([ball <- moveLeft(ball)]) || ([ball <- moveRight(ball)]));` - If the ball is neither at the leftmost nor at the rightmost wall, it must eventually move either to the left or to the right.
7. `(leftmost(ball) && X ([ball <- moveRight(ball)])) -> (!([ball <- moveLeft(ball)]) W rightmost(ball));` - If the ball is at the leftmost wall and is next moving away from it, it must continue not moving to the left until it reaches the rightmost wall.
8. `(rightmost(ball) && X ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)])) -> (!([ball <- moveRight(ball)]) W leftmost(ball));` - If the ball is at the rightmost wall and is next moving away from it, it must continue not moving to the right until it reaches the leftmost wall.
