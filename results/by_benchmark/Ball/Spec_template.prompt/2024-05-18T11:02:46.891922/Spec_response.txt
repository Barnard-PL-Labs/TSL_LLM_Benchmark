Here's how you can translate the given natural language description into a TSL specification:

```tsl
always assume {
  // If the ball is moved to the left, then in the next moment, it is not at the rightmost wall.
  ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)] -> X !rightmost(ball));

  // If the ball is moved to the right, then in the next moment, it is not at the leftmost wall.
  ([ball <- moveRight(ball)] -> X !leftmost(ball));

  // It is always the case that the ball cannot be at both the leftmost and the rightmost wall at the same time.
  !(leftmost(ball) && rightmost(ball));
}

always guarantee {
  // If the ball is at the rightmost wall, eventually it must be moved to the left.
  rightmost(ball) -> F ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)]);

  // If the ball is at the leftmost wall, eventually it must be moved to the right.
  leftmost(ball) -> F ([ball <- moveRight(ball)]);

  // If the ball is neither at the leftmost nor at the rightmost wall, then eventually, it must be moved either to the left or to the right.
  !(leftmost(ball) || rightmost(ball)) -> F ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)] || [ball <- moveRight(ball)]);

  // If the ball is at the leftmost wall and is going to move away from it in the next moment, it must continue not moving to the left until it reaches the rightmost wall.
  (leftmost(ball) && X ([ball <- moveRight(ball)])) -> (X !leftmost(ball) W rightmost(ball));

  // If the ball is at the rightmost wall and is going to move away from it in the next moment, it must continue not moving to the right until it reaches the leftmost wall.
  (rightmost(ball) && X ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)])) -> (X !rightmost(ball) W leftmost(ball));
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions**:
   - The assumptions ensure that moving the ball left or right immediately invalidates being at the opposite wall in the next state.
   - Additionally, it's assumed that the ball can't be at both walls simultaneously, ensuring that action commands are sensible.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - These guarantees maintain the behavior of the ball bouncing between the walls. They specify that if the ball is at one of the walls, it must eventually move away, and once it starts moving away, it cannot move back until it reaches the opposite wall. This creates a "bounce" effect between the walls.
