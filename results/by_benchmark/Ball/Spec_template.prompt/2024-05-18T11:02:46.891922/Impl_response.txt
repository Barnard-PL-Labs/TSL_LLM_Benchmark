To implement the specified functions and predicates using JavaScript, let's first create the function definitions for `moveLeft`, `moveRight`, and the predicates `leftmost`, `rightmost`. These functions and predicates will operate based on some assumed mechanics of how the `ball` interacts with its environment. 

Since we don't have an actual API to modify or directly interact with the `ball`, I will provide a hypothetical implementation that could be used if such an API were available:

```javascript
// Functions to manipulate the state of 'ball'
function moveLeft(ball) {
    // Assuming 'ball' has a property 'position' to indicate its current position
    // Decrease the 'position' value to simulate moving left
    if (ball.position > 0) { // Check to ensure the ball is not at the boundary
        ball.position--;
    }
    return `Signal to move ball to position ${ball.position}`;
}

function moveRight(ball) {
    // Assuming there's a predefined limit, MAX_POSITION, to how far right the ball can go
    if (ball.position < MAX_POSITION) { // Check to ensure the ball is not at the boundary
        ball.position++;
    }
    return `Signal to move ball to position ${ball.position}`;
}

// Predicates to check the position of 'ball'
function leftmost(ball) {
    // Check if the ball's position is at the leftmost point, assumed to be 0
    return ball.position === 0;
}

function rightmost(ball) {
    // Check if the ball's position is at the rightmost point, assumed to be MAX_POSITION
    return ball.position === MAX_POSITION;
}

// Example usage
const MAX_POSITION = 10; // Defining the right boundary for the ball's movement
let ball = { position: 5 }; // Example ball object with an initial position

// Test moving the ball around
console.log(moveLeft(ball)); // Output depends on the ball's initial position
console.log(moveRight(ball));

// Check positions
console.log(leftmost(ball)); // Returns true if the ball is at the leftmost position
console.log(rightmost(ball)); // Returns true if the ball is at the rightmost position
```

In this example:
- We assume the `ball` object has a `position` property that tracks its location on a hypothetical linear track with endpoints at 0 and `MAX_POSITION`.
- The `moveLeft` function decreases the `position` of the ball unless it's already at the leftmost position (position 0).
- The `moveRight` function increases the `position` of the ball unless it's already at the rightmost position (`MAX_POSITION`).
- The `leftmost` predicate checks if the ball is at the leftmost position.
- The `rightmost` predicate checks if the ball is at the rightmost position.

This example assumes a simplistic linear movement and does not account for other potential complexities such as obstacles, multiple dimensions, or other game mechanics. Adjustments would be needed based on the actual details of the ball's environment and the capabilities provided by the full system API.
