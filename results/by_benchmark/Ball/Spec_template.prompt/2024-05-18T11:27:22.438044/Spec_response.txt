Below is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description:

```tsl
always assume {
  ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)] -> X !rightmost(ball));
  ([ball <- moveRight(ball)] -> X !leftmost(ball));
  !(leftmost(ball) && rightmost(ball));
}

always guarantee {
  rightmost(ball) -> F ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)]);
  leftmost(ball) -> F ([ball <- moveRight(ball)]);
  !(leftmost(ball) || rightmost(ball)) -> F ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)] || [ball <- moveRight(ball)]);
  
  (leftmost(ball) && X ([ball <- moveRight(ball)])) -> ([ball <- moveRight(ball)] W rightmost(ball));
  (rightmost(ball) && X ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)])) -> ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)] W leftmost(ball));
}
```

### Explanation:

#### Assumptions Section:
1. If the ball is moved to the left, the next state ensures the ball is not at the rightmost wall.
2. If the ball is moved to the right, the next state ensures the ball is not at the leftmost wall.
3. The ball cannot be at both the leftmost and rightmost walls simultaneously.

#### Guarantees Section:
4. If the ball is at the rightmost wall, it eventually must move left.
5. If the ball is at the leftmost wall, it eventually must move right.
6. If the ball is neither at the leftmost nor at the rightmost wall, it must eventually move either left or right.
7. If at the leftmost wall and about to move right, it should continue moving right until it reaches the rightmost wall.
8. If at the rightmost wall and about to move left, it should continue moving left until it reaches the leftmost wall.
