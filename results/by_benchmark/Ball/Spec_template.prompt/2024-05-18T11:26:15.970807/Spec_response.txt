Here is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description:

```tsl
always assume {
  ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)] -> X !rightmost(ball));
  ([ball <- moveRight(ball)] -> X !leftmost(ball));
  !(leftmost(ball) && rightmost(ball));
}

always guarantee {
  rightmost(ball) -> F ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)]);
  leftmost(ball) -> F ([ball <- moveRight(ball)]);
  !(leftmost(ball) || rightmost(ball)) -> F ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)] || [ball <- moveRight(ball)]);
  (leftmost(ball) && X ([ball <- moveRight(ball)])) -> (!leftmost(ball) W rightmost(ball));
  (rightmost(ball) && X ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)])) -> (!rightmost(ball) W leftmost(ball));
}
```

### Explanation of the TSL Specification:

#### Assumptions:

1. When the ball is moved to the left, in the next state, it cannot be at the rightmost wall.
   ```
   ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)] -> X !rightmost(ball));
   ```

2. When the ball is moved to the right, in the next state, it cannot be at the leftmost wall.
   ```
   ([ball <- moveRight(ball)] -> X !leftmost(ball));
   ```

3. The ball cannot be at both the leftmost and rightmost walls simultaneously.
   ```
   !(leftmost(ball) && rightmost(ball));
   ```

#### Guarantees:

4. If the ball is at the rightmost wall, eventually it will be moved left.
   ```
   rightmost(ball) -> F ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)]);
   ```

5. If the ball is at the leftmost wall, eventually it will be moved right.
   ```
   leftmost(ball) -> F ([ball <- moveRight(ball)]);
   ```

6. If the ball is neither at the leftmost nor at the rightmost wall, it must eventually move either left or right.
   ```
   !(leftmost(ball) || rightmost(ball)) -> F ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)] || [ball <- moveRight(ball)]);
   ```

7. If the ball is at the leftmost wall and is going to move right in the next moment, it must continue moving right until it reaches the rightmost wall.
   ```
   (leftmost(ball) && X ([ball <- moveRight(ball)])) -> (!leftmost(ball) W rightmost(ball));
   ```

8. If the ball is at the rightmost wall and is going to move left in the next moment, it must continue moving left until it reaches the leftmost wall.
   ```
   (rightmost(ball) && X ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)])) -> (!rightmost(ball) W leftmost(ball));
   ```
