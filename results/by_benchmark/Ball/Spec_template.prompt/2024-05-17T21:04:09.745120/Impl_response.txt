Below is an implementation of the methods you've specified in JavaScript, using a hypothetical API and system behavior for ball movement and wall detection. Since the actual API methods, such as how to change the ball's direction or check its position, are not provided, the following example assumes some basic operations that might exist.

```javascript
// Assuming there exists some kind of API to interact with the ball and its environment
// These are hypothetical and should be replaced with the actual API calls.

// Functions to manipulate the ball's position
function moveLeft(ball) {
    // API call to send the signal to move the ball to the left
    // This is a hypothetical function; replace it with the actual function call
    return `Move ${ball} to the left`;
}

function moveRight(ball) {
    // API call to send the signal to move the ball to the right
    // This is a hypothetical function; replace it with the actual function call
    return `Move ${ball} to the right`;
}

// Predicates to check the ball's position against the walls
function leftmost(ball) {
    // API call to check if the ball is at the leftmost position
    // This is a hypothetical predicate; replace it with the actual predicate call
    // Returns true if the ball is at the leftmost wall, false otherwise
    return ball.position === ball.minPosition; // Assuming 'position' and 'minPosition' are defined in the ball's state
}

function rightmost(ball) {
    // API call to check if the ball is at the rightmost position
    // This is a hypothetical predicate; replace it with the actual predicate call
    // Returns true if the ball is at the rightmost wall, false otherwise
    return ball.position === ball.maxPosition; // Assuming 'position' and 'maxPosition' are defined in the ball's state
}

// Example usage:
let ball = {
    position: 0,
    minPosition: 0,
    maxPosition: 10
};

console.log(moveLeft(ball)); // Output might depend on the actual move implementation
console.log(moveRight(ball)); // Output might depend on the actual move implementation
console.log(leftmost(ball)); // Should return true if the ball is at the leftmost position
console.log(rightmost(ball)); // Should return true if the ball is at the rightmost position
```

### Key Points:
1. **moveLeft** and **moveRight** assume there are API methods that accept a ball object and manipulate its position. These should be replaced with actual function calls that interact with the ball's state or environment.
2. **leftmost** and **rightmost** are predicates that check the ball's current position against its boundaries. These boundaries (minPosition and maxPosition) must be defined or accessible within the ball's state.

Ensure you replace the hypothetical calls and properties with actual API methods and properties provided by your system's documentation.
