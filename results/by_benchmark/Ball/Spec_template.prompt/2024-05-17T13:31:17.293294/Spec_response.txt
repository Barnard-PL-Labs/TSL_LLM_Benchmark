### Explanation:

**Assumptions:**
1. If the ball is commanded to move left, then in the next time step, it won't be found at the rightmost wall.
2. Similarly, if the command is to move right, it won't be at the leftmost wall next.
3. The ball can't simultaneously be at both the leftmost and rightmost walls.

**Guarantees:**
4. If the ball is at the rightmost wall, eventually it must receive a command to move left.
5. Conversely, if it's at the leftmost wall, it must eventually receive a command to move right.
6. If it's not at either wall, it must eventually move in either direction.
7. Additionally, if the ball is at the leftmost wall and is set to move right, it should continue moving right until it reaches the rightmost wall.
8. Similarly, if it's at the rightmost wall and begins moving left, it should continue in that direction until it reaches the leftmost wall.
