Given the provided task, here's how you might implement the requested functions and predicates in JavaScript. The implementation assumes you have some way of defining what constitutes "leftmost" and "rightmost" positions, which would typically be determined by the boundaries of a playing field or a similar context.

Let's define these functions and predicates:

```javascript
// Define the functions that modify the state of the 'ball' cell

/**
 * Moves the ball to the left by updating the 'ball' state.
 * @param {object} ball - The current state of the ball.
 * @returns {object} - New state of the ball moved left.
 */
function moveLeft(ball) {
    if (!leftmost(ball)) {
        // Assuming 'x' is a property of 'ball' that defines its horizontal position
        return {...ball, x: ball.x - 1}; // Move the ball left by decreasing x
    }
    return ball; // Return the ball as is if it's at the leftmost position
}

/**
 * Moves the ball to the right by updating the 'ball' state.
 * @param {object} ball - The current state of the ball.
 * @returns {object} - New state of the ball moved right.
 */
function moveRight(ball) {
    if (!rightmost(ball)) {
        // Assuming 'x' is a property of 'ball' that defines its horizontal position
        return {...ball, x: ball.x + 1}; // Move the ball right by increasing x
    }
    return ball; // Return the ball as is if it's at the rightmost position
}

// Define the predicates that check the position of the ball

/**
 * Checks if the ball is against the leftmost wall.
 * @param {object} ball - The current state of the ball.
 * @returns {boolean} - True if the ball is at the leftmost position, false otherwise.
 */
function leftmost(ball) {
    // Assuming 'x' is a property of 'ball' and '0' is the leftmost value
    return ball.x === 0;
}

/**
 * Checks if the ball is against the rightmost wall.
 * @param {object} ball - The current state of the ball.
 * @returns {boolean} - True if the ball is at the rightmost position, false otherwise.
 */
function rightmost(ball) {
    // Assuming 'x' is a property of 'ball' and 'maxX' is the rightmost value (needs to be defined)
    const maxX = 10; // Example: rightmost boundary at x = 10
    return ball.x === maxX;
}

// Example usage
const ball = { x: 5 };
console.log(moveLeft(ball));  // { x: 4 }
console.log(moveRight(ball)); // { x: 6 }
console.log(leftmost(ball));  // false
console.log(rightmost(ball)); // false
```

This code provides a basic structure for implementing the movement logic and boundary checks for the ball in a hypothetical environment. Adjust the `maxX` variable and other logic according to the actual dimensions and requirements of your application environment.
