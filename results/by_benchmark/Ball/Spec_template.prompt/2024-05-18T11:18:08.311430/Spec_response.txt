Here is the TSL specification based on the provided description and functional requirements:

```tsl
always assume {
  ([ ball <- moveLeft(ball) ] -> X !rightmost(ball));
  ([ ball <- moveRight(ball) ] -> X !leftmost(ball));
  !(leftmost(ball) && rightmost(ball));
}

always guarantee {
  rightmost(ball) -> F ([ ball <- moveLeft(ball) ]);
  leftmost(ball) -> F ([ ball <- moveRight(ball) ]);
  !(leftmost(ball) || rightmost(ball)) -> F ([ ball <- moveLeft(ball) ] || [ ball <- moveRight(ball) ]);
  (leftmost(ball) && X ([ ball <- moveRight(ball) ])) -> ([ ball <- moveRight(ball) ] W rightmost(ball));
  (rightmost(ball) && X ([ ball <- moveLeft(ball) ])) -> ([ ball <- moveLeft(ball) ] W leftmost(ball));
}
```

### Explanation:

#### Assumptions:
1. Moving the ball to the left guarantees that in the next time step, the ball will not be at the rightmost wall.
2. Moving the ball to the right guarantees that in the next time step, the ball will not be at the leftmost wall.
3. The ball cannot be simultaneously at the leftmost and the rightmost walls.

#### Guarantees:
4. If the ball is at the rightmost wall, it will eventually be commanded to move left.
5. If the ball is at the leftmost wall, it will eventually be commanded to move right.
6. If the ball is neither at the leftmost nor at the rightmost walls, it will eventually receive a command to move either left or right.
7. If a command is issued to move the ball right from the leftmost wall, it must continue moving right until it reaches the rightmost wall.
8. Similarly, if a command is issued to move the ball left from the rightmost wall, it must continue moving left until it reaches the leftmost wall.
