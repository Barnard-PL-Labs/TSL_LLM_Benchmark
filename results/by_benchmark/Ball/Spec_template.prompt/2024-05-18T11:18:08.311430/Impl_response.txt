Based on the description provided, here are the JavaScript implementations of the functions and predicates for the cell "ball" using basic JavaScript constructs. Given the lack of specific API details, this example assumes simple functions and boolean operations.

### Functions

These functions manipulate or interact with the "ball" parameter assuming it has properties that can be modified or accessed. In this case, let's assume we can control the ball's horizontal position via some property like `positionX`.

```javascript
/**
 * Moves the ball to the left by decreasing its positionX value.
 * @param {Object} ball - The ball object with its current state.
 * @returns {Object} The updated ball object.
 */
function moveLeft(ball) {
    ball.positionX -= 1;  // Decreases the x-coordinate to simulate movement to the left.
    return ball;
}

/**
 * Moves the ball to the right by increasing its positionX value.
 * @param {Object} ball - The ball object with its current state.
 * @returns {Object} The updated ball object.
 */
function moveRight(ball) {
    ball.positionX += 1;  // Increases the x-coordinate to simulate movement to the right.
    return ball;
}
```

### Predicates

These predicates assess the state of the "ball". They return a boolean indicating whether the ball is at either the leftmost or rightmost position. Let's assume there are predefined constants or boundaries such as `LEFT_WALL` and `RIGHT_WALL`.

```javascript
// Constants defining the boundaries of the movement
const LEFT_WALL = 0;
const RIGHT_WALL = 10; // Assuming the rightmost wall position is at 10

/**
 * Determines if the ball is against the leftmost wall.
 * @param {Object} ball - The ball object with its current state.
 * @returns {boolean} True if the ball is at the leftmost position, false otherwise.
 */
function leftmost(ball) {
    return ball.positionX <= LEFT_WALL;
}

/**
 * Determines if the ball is against the rightmost wall.
 * @param {Object} ball - The ball object with its current state.
 * @returns {boolean} True if the ball is at the rightmost position, false otherwise.
 */
function rightmost(ball) {
    return ball.positionX >= RIGHT_WALL;
}
```

### Example Usage

Here is how you might use these functions and predicates to control and check the position of a "ball" object.

```javascript
let ball = { positionX: 5 };

// Move the ball to the left
ball = moveLeft(ball);
console.log(ball); // Should log something like { positionX: 4 }

// Check if the ball is at the leftmost position
console.log(leftmost(ball)); // Should log 'false' if LEFT_WALL is 0

// Move the ball right and check if it reaches the rightmost position
ball = moveRight(ball);
ball = moveRight(ball);
console.log(rightmost(ball)); // Should log 'false' depending on the position
```

This implementation makes simple assumptions about the structure and behavior of the "ball" and its environment. Adjust the logic as necessary based on actual system specifications and properties.
