To implement the described methods in JavaScript for controlling the movement of a ball within a system environment and checking its state against boundaries, we will define functions for moving the ball left or right and predicates to determine if the ball is at the leftmost or rightmost edges. Since no specific API or framework details are provided, we will assume a generic structure for the `ball` object and operations.

### Functions

1. **moveLeft(ball)**: This function will modify the `ball` object (or its equivalent signal) to indicate that the ball should move left.
2. **moveRight(ball)**: This function will modify the `ball` object to indicate that the ball should move right.

### Predicates

1. **leftmost(ball)**: This predicate will check if the ball is at the leftmost boundary.
2. **rightmost(ball)**: This predicate will check if the ball is at the rightmost boundary.

Assuming the `ball` object contains a property such as `position` which can be decremented or incremented to move left or right, and boundaries are defined as `leftBoundary` and `rightBoundary`, here's how you could implement these functions and predicates:

```javascript
// Hypothetical properties of the ball object
let environment = {
    ball: {
        position: 5, // Arbitrary starting position
        leftBoundary: 0,
        rightBoundary: 10
    }
};

// Functions
function moveLeft(ball) {
    // Ensure the ball doesn't move past the left boundary
    if (ball.position > ball.leftBoundary) {
        ball.position -= 1;
    }
    return ball; // Return updated ball state
}

function moveRight(ball) {
    // Ensure the ball doesn't move past the right boundary
    if (ball.position < ball.rightBoundary) {
        ball.position += 1;
    }
    return ball; // Return updated ball state
}

// Predicates
function leftmost(ball) {
    return ball.position === ball.leftBoundary;
}

function rightmost(ball) {
    return ball.position === ball.rightBoundary;
}

// Example usage
console.log("Initial Position:", environment.ball.position);
moveLeft(environment.ball);
console.log("After moveLeft:", environment.ball.position);
moveRight(environment.ball);
console.log("After moveRight:", environment.ball.position);

console.log("Is at leftmost?", leftmost(environment.ball));
console.log("Is at rightmost?", rightmost(environment.ball));
```

This example assumes:
- `position` is the current horizontal position of the `ball`.
- `leftBoundary` and `rightBoundary` define the limits of movement.
- The ball moves in discrete steps and checks ensure it does not move beyond these boundaries.

These functions and predicates should be adapted based on the actual structure and capabilities of the system and API you are interfacing with.
