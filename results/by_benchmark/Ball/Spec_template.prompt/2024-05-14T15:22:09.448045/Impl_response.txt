To implement the described system functionality using JavaScript, first, we need to define the methods for "functions" and "predicates" related to managing the state and behavior of a "ball" object within an environment. These methods will control the movement of the ball and check its position against the edges of the environment (leftmost and rightmost walls).

Let's assume that the "ball" object has properties that can be manipulated or checked, such as its current position. For simplicity, we will represent the ball's position with a numeric variable that indicates its horizontal position. In this setup, we could define the boundaries of the environment (e.g., a leftmost wall at position 0 and a rightmost wall at position 10).

Here's the JavaScript implementation:

```javascript
// Define the ball object with an initial position
let ball = {
    position: 5 // Assuming the middle of a scale from 0 to 10
};

// Functions:
function moveLeft(ball) {
    // Move the ball to the left by decreasing its position by 1
    // Ensure that the ball does not cross the leftmost boundary
    if (ball.position > 0) {
        ball.position -= 1;
    }
    return ball.position;
}

function moveRight(ball) {
    // Move the ball to the right by increasing its position by 1
    // Ensure that the ball does not cross the rightmost boundary
    if (ball.position < 10) {
        ball.position += 1;
    }
    return ball.position;
}

// Predicates:
function leftmost(ball) {
    // Check if the ball is at the leftmost position (position 0)
    return ball.position === 0;
}

function rightmost(ball) {
    // Check if the ball is at the rightmost position (position 10)
    return ball.position === 10;
}

// Example Usage:
console.log("Initial Position:", ball.position);
console.log("Move Left:", moveLeft(ball));
console.log("Is Leftmost:", leftmost(ball));
console.log("Move Right:", moveRight(ball));
console.log("Is Rightmost:", rightmost(ball));
```

This implementation consists of:
1. **ball object**: Represents the ball with a `position` property.
2. **moveLeft() and moveRight() functions**: These manage the ball's position by decrementing or incrementing its `position` property, ensuring it does not pass the defined boundaries (0 for leftmost and 10 for rightmost).
3. **leftmost() and rightmost() predicates**: These functions check whether the ball is at either the leftmost or the rightmost positions, respectively.

This basic setup allows you to manipulate and query the state of the ball within a constrained linear environment. Adjust the boundary values according to the actual requirements or constraints of your environment.
