To implement the specified functions and predicates in JavaScript, we first need to understand the conceptual structure of our system and how the `ball` cell represents the state of the signal controlling the ball's movement. We'll assume that the `ball` cell may store information related to its position or any other relevant data.

Given the lack of specific details about the `ball` cell's structure, I'll provide abstract implementations that assume some form of state manipulation or querying mechanism exists. You may need to adapt these implementations according to the actual API specifics or system context.

### JavaScript Implementations

#### Functions
1. **moveLeft(ball)** - This function would typically adjust the internal state of the `ball` to signal a move to the left. Assuming `ball` has a property like `position` that can be decremented:
    ```javascript
    function moveLeft(ball) {
        // Assuming 'ball.position' exists and represents the x-coordinate
        if (!leftmost(ball)) {  // Check to prevent moving into the wall
            ball.position -= 1;
        }
        return ball;  // Return the updated state of 'ball'
    }
    ```

2. **moveRight(ball)** - Similarly, this function adjusts the `ball`'s state to move it to the right:
    ```javascript
    function moveRight(ball) {
        // Assuming 'ball.position' exists and represents the x-coordinate
        if (!rightmost(ball)) {  // Check to prevent moving into the wall
            ball.position += 1;
        }
        return ball;  // Return the updated state of 'ball'
    }
    ```

#### Predicates
1. **leftmost(ball)** - This predicate checks if the `ball` is against the leftmost wall. Assuming a minimal position value:
    ```javascript
    function leftmost(ball) {
        // Assuming 'ball.position' exists and '0' is the leftmost position
        return ball.position === 0;
    }
    ```

2. **rightmost(ball)** - Checks if the `ball` is against the rightmost wall. Assuming a maximal position value (let's say 10 for example):
    ```javascript
    function rightmost(ball) {
        // Assuming 'ball.position' exists and '10' is the rightmost position
        return ball.position === 10;
    }
    ```

### Usage Example

Hereâ€™s how you might use these functions and predicates within a game loop or control logic:

```javascript
function gameLoop(ball) {
    if (leftmost(ball)) {
        console.log("Ball is at the leftmost position.");
        moveRight(ball);
    } else if (rightmost(ball)) {
        console.log("Ball is at the rightmost position.");
        moveLeft(ball);
    } else {
        // Example logic: move ball right by default
        moveRight(ball);
    }
}
```

Ensure to adjust these implementations based on the actual data structure and methods available in your specific system environment. This code assumes direct manipulation of an object property (`ball.position`), which might differ in your actual environment.
