Here is the TSL specification for the scenario described:

```tsl
always assume {
  ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)] -> X !rightmost(ball));
  ([ball <- moveRight(ball)] -> X !leftmost(ball));
  !(leftmost(ball) && rightmost(ball));
}

always guarantee {
  rightmost(ball) -> F ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)]);
  leftmost(ball) -> F ([ball <- moveRight(ball)]);
  !(leftmost(ball) || rightmost(ball)) -> F ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)] || [ball <- moveRight(ball)]);
  (leftmost(ball) && X ([ball <- moveRight(ball)])) -> (!leftmost(ball) W rightmost(ball));
  (rightmost(ball) && X ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)])) -> (!rightmost(ball) W leftmost(ball));
}
```

### Explanation:

#### Assumptions:

1. **Movement to the left implies not being at the rightmost wall immediately after**: When the ball moves left, the next state ensures it's not at the rightmost wall.
2. **Movement to the right ensures not being at the leftmost wall immediately after**: Moving the ball to the right ensures that it won't be at the leftmost wall in the following state.
3. **Mutual exclusivity of wall positions**: The ball cannot be at the leftmost and rightmost walls at the same time.

#### Guarantees:

4. **Movement from the rightmost wall**: If the ball is at the rightmost wall, it must eventually move to the left.
5. **Movement from the leftmost wall**: If the ball is positioned at the leftmost wall, it must eventually move to the right.
6. **General movement directive**: If the ball is not at any wall, it must eventually move in either direction.
7. **Leftmost to rightmost transition**: If the ball is at the leftmost wall and moves right in the next moment, it must continue moving right until it reaches the rightmost wall.
8. **Rightmost to leftmost transition**: If the ball is at the rightmost wall and moves left in the next moment, it must continue moving left until it reaches the leftmost wall.

This TSL specification ensures the behavior of the ball bouncing between two end walls while maintaining the logical constraints provided.
