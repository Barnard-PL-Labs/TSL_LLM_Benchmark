Based on your description, let's implement the JavaScript functions and predicates you've outlined for the system managing the "ball" cell.

Here's how you might script these functionalities:

### Functions

#### 1. `moveLeft(ball)`
Moves the ball to the left.

```javascript
function moveLeft(ball) {
    // Assuming 'ball' is an object which can store its position
    return ball.position.x -= 1;  // Decrement the x-coordinate to move left
}
```

#### 2. `moveRight(ball)`
Moves the ball to the right.

```javascript
function moveRight(ball) {
    // Assuming 'ball' is an object which can store its position
    return ball.position.x += 1;  // Increment the x-coordinate to move right
}
```

### Predicates

#### 1. `leftmost(ball)`
Checks if the ball is at the leftmost position.

```javascript
function leftmost(ball) {
    // Assuming there's a defined limit for the leftmost position
    return ball.position.x === 0;  // Returns true if the ball's x-coordinate is 0
}
```

#### 2. `rightmost(ball)`
Checks if the ball is at the rightmost position.

```javascript
function rightmost(ball) {
    // Assuming there's a defined limit for the rightmost position
    const rightmostLimit = 10;  // This should be set according to your system dimensions
    return ball.position.x === rightmostLimit;  // Returns true if the ball's x-coordinate is at the rightmost limit
}
```

### Considerations

- **Object Model**: I'm assuming `ball` is an object with a `position` property. This position is likely represented with x (and possibly y) coordinates.

- **Boundary Definitions**: The predicates `leftmost` and `rightmost` assume certain boundaries (like `x === 0` for the leftmost and `x === 10` for the rightmost). These limits should be adjusted based on your system's actual configuration.

- **Movement Functions**: The `moveLeft` and `moveRight` functions modify the `x` property of the ball's position directly. If your API or system has specific methods for movement or updating the state, you should use those instead.

Ensure that these methods integrate correctly with your system's actual architecture, especially how the `ball` object and its position are managed and how changes in its state are handled or rendered in your environment.
