To implement the described methods in JavaScript, we will define functions for `moveLeft` and `moveRight`, and predicates for `leftmost` and `rightmost`. Since these predicates return boolean values, they will check the position of the ball relative to predefined boundaries assumed to represent the walls.

Here's how you might implement these functions and predicates:

```javascript
// Define global boundaries for the sake of example. You may have these defined elsewhere in your project.
const LEFT_WALL = 0;
const RIGHT_WALL = 100; // assuming the playing area width is 100 units.

// Represents the state of the ball. Let's assume it starts at position 50.
let ball = {
    position: 50
};

/**
 * Moves the ball to the left by decreasing its position by 1.
 * @param {object} ball - The ball object with its current state.
 * @returns {object} - Returns the updated ball object.
 */
function moveLeft(ball) {
    if (ball.position > LEFT_WALL) {
        ball.position -= 1;
    }
    return ball;
}

/**
 * Moves the ball to the right by increasing its position by 1.
 * @param {object} ball - The ball object with its current state.
 * @returns {object} - Returns the updated ball object.
 */
function moveRight(ball) {
    if (ball.position < RIGHT_WALL) {
        ball.position += 1;
    }
    return ball;
}

/**
 * Checks if the ball is at the leftmost position.
 * @param {object} ball - The ball object with its current state.
 * @returns {boolean} - True if the ball is at the leftmost position, otherwise false.
 */
function leftmost(ball) {
    return ball.position === LEFT_WALL;
}

/**
 * Checks if the ball is at the rightmost position.
 * @param {object} ball - The ball object with its current state.
 * @returns {boolean} - True if the ball is at the rightmost position, otherwise false.
 */
function rightmost(ball) {
    return ball.position === RIGHT_WALL;
}

// Example usage
console.log("Initial position:", ball.position);
moveLeft(ball);
console.log("After moving left:", ball.position);
console.log("Is at leftmost?", leftmost(ball));
moveRight(ball);
moveRight(ball);
console.log("After moving right twice:", ball.position);
console.log("Is at rightmost?", rightmost(ball));
```

### Explanation:

1. **Global Boundaries:** `LEFT_WALL` and `RIGHT_WALL` are defined to simulate the environment's boundaries. You can adjust these values based on the actual dimensions of your project.

2. **Ball State:** The `ball` object is initialized with a `position` property. This object is manipulated by the `moveLeft` and `moveRight` functions which modify the `position`.

3. **Functions:** `moveLeft` and `moveRight` adjust the `position` of the `ball` within the confines of the `LEFT_WALL` and `RIGHT_WALL`. These functions ensure that the ball does not move beyond the boundaries.

4. **Predicates:** `leftmost` and `rightmost` functions check whether the ball's `position` matches the boundary positions, and return a boolean value accordingly.

5. **Example usage:** Demonstrates how the ball's position changes with movements and boundary checks.

This implementation assumes a simple model where the ball moves in a linear space between two walls. Adjustments might be needed depending on further details about how the ball and walls are represented in the actual system.
