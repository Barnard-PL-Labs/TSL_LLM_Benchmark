Given your description, I'll provide a JavaScript implementation for the `updateState` function which simulates the described behavior of a ball bouncing between two walls.

```javascript
function updateState({ currentState }) {
    // "currentState" is expected to be an object that includes the current position of the ball
    let { ball } = currentState;

    // Check if the ball is at the leftmost wall
    if (leftmost(ball)) {
        // Since the ball is at the leftmost wall, move it to the right
        ball = moveRight(ball);
    } 
    // Check if the ball is at the rightmost wall
    else if (rightmost(ball)) {
        // Since the ball is at the rightmost wall, move it to the left
        ball = moveLeft(ball);
    } 
    // If the ball is not at either wall
    else {
        // Determine the direction based on the current state's direction attribute
        // If no direction is specified, default to moving right
        if (currentState.direction === 'left') {
            ball = moveLeft(ball);
        } else {
            ball = moveRight(ball);
        }
    }

    // Update the direction of movement for the next state based on current movement
    const direction = (currentState.direction === 'left' && !leftmost(ball)) ? 'left' :
                      (currentState.direction === 'right' && !rightmost(ball)) ? 'right' :
                      !leftmost(ball) ? 'right' : 'left';

    // Return the updated state
    return { currentState: { ball, direction } };
}

// Helper function to simulate the leftmost check
function leftmost(ball) {
    return ball === 0;
}

// Helper function to simulate the rightmost check
function rightmost(ball) {
    return ball === 10;
}

// Function to simulate movement to the left
function moveLeft(ball) {
    return Math.max(0, ball - 1);
}

// Function to simulate movement to the right
function moveRight(ball) {
    return Math.min(10, ball + 1);
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Structure**: The function `updateState` takes an object with `currentState` which contains the current position of the ball and its direction of movement.
2. **Wall Checks**: It uses `leftmost` and `rightmost` functions to determine whether the ball is against either wall.
3. **Movement Logic**:
   - If the ball is at the leftmost position, it is moved right.
   - If at the rightmost, it is moved left.
   - Otherwise, the direction from the current state is used to decide the next move. If no direction is specified, it defaults to moving right.
4. **Direction Update**: After moving, the direction for the next state is updated based on the current movement and position.
5. **State Return**: The function returns the new `currentState` object containing the updated position and direction of the ball.

The code assumes the ball's position is an integer between 0 and 10 and that the direction of the ball's movement (left or right) is tracked in the state for determining continuous movement. If no direction is specified initially, it defaults to moving to the right.
