To create a TSL specification that mimics the behavior of a ball bouncing between two walls according to the given natural language description, we'll employ a combination of predicates and functions that determine the ball's movement based on its position. This bouncing behavior implies that when the ball reaches one wall (leftmost or rightmost), it should reverse direction until it reaches the opposite wall.

Here is a TSL specification that captures this behavior:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Assume at any point, the ball must be at one of the positions from 0 to 10
  (ball >= 0 && ball <= 10);
}

always guarantee {
  // When the ball is at the leftmost position (0), the next move should be to the right
  (leftmost(ball)) -> X ([ball <- moveRight(ball)]);

  // When the ball is at the rightmost position (10), the next move should be to the left
  (rightmost(ball)) -> X ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)]);

  // If the ball is not at any wall, it should continue in the current direction
  (!(leftmost(ball) || rightmost(ball))) -> (
    (ballDirection == "right") -> X ([ball <- moveRight(ball)])
    && (ballDirection == "left") -> X ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)])
  );
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Assumptions**:
   - The ballâ€™s position is always between 0 and 10, inclusive. This is a bounded environment constraint.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - **When the ball is at the leftmost position (0)**: The next state should signal a move to the right (`moveRight` function).
   - **When the ball is at the rightmost position (10)**: The next state should signal a move to the left (`moveLeft` function).
   - **When not at a boundary**: The ball should continue moving in its current direction. This is controlled by a hypothetical state variable `ballDirection`, which would need to be managed to reflect the current direction of the ball ('right' or 'left'). This part of the guarantee assumes there is some mechanism (not shown here due to the scope of the description) by which `ballDirection` switches between "right" and "left" when the ends are reached.

This specification provides a dynamic model for a ball bouncing between two boundaries, reflecting the continuous change in position and direction based on boundary conditions.
