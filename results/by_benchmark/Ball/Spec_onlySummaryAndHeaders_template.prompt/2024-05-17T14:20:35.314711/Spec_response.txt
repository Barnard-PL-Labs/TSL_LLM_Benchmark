To translate the provided natural language description into a TSL specification, we need to map the behavior of the ball bouncing between the walls into logical statements using the available functions and predicates. Hereâ€™s how it can be expressed:

```
always assume {
  // There are no additional environmental assumptions required beyond the function and predicate declarations
}

always guarantee {
  // When the ball is at the leftmost position, it should move to the right in the next step
  leftmost(ball) -> X ([ ball <- moveRight(ball) ]);

  // When the ball is at the rightmost position, it should move to the left in the next step
  rightmost(ball) -> X ([ ball <- moveLeft(ball) ]);

  // When the ball is not at either boundary, it should continue in its current direction
  !(leftmost(ball) || rightmost(ball)) -> ([ ball <- ball ]);
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Assumptions**: We assume that `leftmost(ball)` and `rightmost(ball)` accurately reflect the ball's position at the boundaries. There are no additional environmental inputs that affect the ball's position directly, so no extra assumptions are needed.
- **Guarantees**: 
  - If the ball reaches the leftmost position (`leftmost(ball)`), it is instructed to move right in the next state (`X ([ ball <- moveRight(ball) ])`).
  - If the ball reaches the rightmost position (`rightmost(ball)`), it is instructed to move left in the next state (`X ([ ball <- moveLeft(ball) ])`).
  - If the ball is neither at the leftmost nor at the rightmost position, it will continue in its current direction. This is a simplification assuming some external mechanism or previous state continues to move the ball in the current direction.

This TSL specification captures the bouncing behavior of the ball between two fixed points.
