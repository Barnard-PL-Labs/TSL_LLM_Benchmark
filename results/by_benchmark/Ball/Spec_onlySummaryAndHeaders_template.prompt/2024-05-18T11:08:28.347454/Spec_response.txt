Here is the TSL specification based on the provided description of a ball bouncing between two walls:

```tsl
always assume {
  // The ball must be either at a position between 0 and 10, inclusive
  (ball >= 0 && ball <= 10);
}

always guarantee {
  // If the ball is at the leftmost position and not moving right, it should start moving right
  (leftmost(ball) && ![ball <- moveRight(ball)]) -> [ball <- moveRight(ball)];

  // If the ball is at the rightmost position and not moving left, it should start moving left
  (rightmost(ball) && ![ball <- moveLeft(ball)]) -> [ball <- moveLeft(ball)];

  // If the ball is moving left and not yet at the leftmost position, continue moving left
  (!leftmost(ball) && [ball <- moveLeft(ball)]) -> X ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)] W leftmost(ball));

  // If the ball is moving right and not yet at the rightmost position, continue moving right
  (!rightmost(ball) && [ball <- moveRight(ball)]) -> X ([ball <- moveRight(ball)] W rightmost(ball));
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions**:
   - The ball's position is assumed to be within the range `[0, 10]`, which represents the space between the two walls.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - When the ball is at the leftmost position (`leftmost(ball)`) and it's not already moving right, it should be commanded to move right (`[ball <- moveRight(ball)]`).
   - When the ball is at the rightmost position (`rightmost(ball)`) and it's not already moving left, it should be commanded to move left (`[ball <- moveLeft(ball)]`).
   - If the ball is moving left and not at the leftmost wall, it should continue moving left on the next state and keep doing so until it reaches the leftmost position.
   - If the ball is moving right and not at the rightmost wall, it should continue moving right on the next state and keep doing so until it reaches the rightmost position. This ensures the bouncing behavior between the two walls.
