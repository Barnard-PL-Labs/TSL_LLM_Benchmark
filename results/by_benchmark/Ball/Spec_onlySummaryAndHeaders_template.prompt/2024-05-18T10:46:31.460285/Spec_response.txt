Here's the TSL specification based on the natural language description provided:

```tsl
always assume {
  // The ball can only be at the leftmost or rightmost position
  (leftmost(ball) || rightmost(ball));
}

always guarantee {
  // If the ball is at the leftmost position, it should move right in the next state
  leftmost(ball) -> X ([ball <- moveRight(ball)]);
  
  // If the ball is at the rightmost position, it should move left in the next state
  rightmost(ball) -> X ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)]);
}
```

This specification captures the behavior of a ball bouncing between two walls, obeying the constraints that when it hits either wall, it should move in the opposite direction in the next state. The use of the `X` (next) operator ensures that the specified action happens immediately in the next time step after the condition is met.
