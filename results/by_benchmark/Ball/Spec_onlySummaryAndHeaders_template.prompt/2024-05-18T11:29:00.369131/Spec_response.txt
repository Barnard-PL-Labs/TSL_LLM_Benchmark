Here's the TSL specification for a ball bouncing between two walls, with the position represented as described:

```tsl
always assume {
  // The ball must be within the bounds of 0 to 10 at all times
  (ball >= 0 && ball <= 10);
}

always guarantee {
  // If the ball is at the leftmost position, it should move right
  leftmost(ball) -> [ball <- moveRight(ball)];
  
  // If the ball is at the rightmost position, it should move left
  rightmost(ball) -> [ball <- moveLeft(ball)];
}
```

This specification ensures that the ball always stays within the defined boundaries and changes its direction appropriately when it hits either wall.
