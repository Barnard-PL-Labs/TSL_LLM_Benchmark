To implement the required functions and predicates in JavaScript based on your description, we first need to clarify how the "ball" cell is structured and how it interacts with the system. Since you've mentioned it represents the state of the signal that determines how the ball should move, it would typically involve updating or checking properties related to the ball's position.

Here's a basic JavaScript implementation of the described functions and predicates:

```javascript
// Assuming "ball" is an object that stores its "x" position within a "position" property
// Let's also assume that the ball moves on a 1D line from position 0 (leftmost) to position 10 (rightmost)

let ball = {
    position: 5  // starting from the middle
};

// Functions to move the ball left or right
function moveLeft(ball) {
    // Move the ball left by decreasing the x position, ensuring it doesn't go below 0
    if (ball.position > 0) {
        ball.position -= 1;
        return "Moved left";
    }
    return "Already at leftmost position";
}

function moveRight(ball) {
    // Move the ball right by increasing the x position, ensuring it doesn't exceed 10
    if (ball.position < 10) {
        ball.position += 1;
        return "Moved right";
    }
    return "Already at rightmost position";
}

// Predicates to check if the ball is at the leftmost or rightmost positions
function leftmost(ball) {
    return ball.position === 0;
}

function rightmost(ball) {
    return ball.position === 10;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(moveLeft(ball));  // Moves the ball to the left
console.log(moveRight(ball)); // Moves the ball to the right
console.log(leftmost(ball));  // Checks if the ball is at the leftmost position
console.log(rightmost(ball)); // Checks if the ball is at the rightmost position
```

### Explanation
1. **Ball Object**: We assume `ball` is an object with a property `position` that stores the x-coordinate. You can adjust the range according to your system's design (here, 0 to 10).

2. **moveLeft and moveRight Functions**: These functions alter the `position` of the `ball` object. They check boundaries to avoid moving the ball out of the defined range and return a message indicating the action or restraint.

3. **leftmost and rightmost Predicates**: These functions return a boolean value indicating whether the `ball` is at the leftmost or rightmost position by checking its `position` property.

This setup assumes simple control logic without any asynchronous or external API interaction. Adjust the range and logic according to your system specifics and API details.
