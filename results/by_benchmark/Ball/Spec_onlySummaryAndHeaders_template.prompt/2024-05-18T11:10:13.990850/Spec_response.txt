Here's a TSL specification that models the behavior of a ball bouncing between two walls, based on the provided functions, predicates, and natural language description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensures mutual exclusion; the ball cannot be at both extremes at the same instant
  !(leftmost(ball) && rightmost(ball));
}

always guarantee {
  // When the ball is at the leftmost position, the next action is to move right
  leftmost(ball) -> X ([ball <- moveRight(ball)]);
  
  // When the ball is at the rightmost position, the next action is to move left
  rightmost(ball) -> X ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)]);
  
  // While the ball isn't at either extreme, it should keep moving in the current direction
  // Assuming some additional internal state to track direction is needed, not explicitly defined here.
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions**:
   - The ball cannot simultaneously be at both the leftmost and rightmost positions, ensuring a logical separation of states.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - If the ball reaches the leftmost wall (`leftmost(ball)`), the next action should move it to the right (`moveRight(ball)`).
   - Conversely, if it reaches the rightmost wall (`rightmost(ball)`), it should then move left (`moveLeft(ball)`).
   - The continuation of movement when the ball is not at either extreme suggests a need for additional state tracking (not provided in the scenario) to determine the current direction of the ball.

This TSL specification provides a framework to model the described behavior of the bouncing ball, relying on the assumption of some additional mechanism to handle state when the ball is between the two extremes.
