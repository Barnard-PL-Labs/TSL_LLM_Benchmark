To implement the given functions and predicates in JavaScript using the system's API for managing the "ball" cell's behavior, we'll create JavaScript functions that interact with the `ball` cell. The `ball` cell can be assumed to hold or represent the position of the ball in some way, although the exact mechanism for how the ball's state is manipulated isn't specified directly in your description.

### JavaScript Implementation

Here, I'll define the functions `moveLeft`, `moveRight` and the predicates `leftmost`, `rightmost`. The implementation assumes that the `ball` object or value can be adjusted or checked directly through these functions:

```javascript
// Functions to control the ball's movement
function moveLeft(ball) {
    // Assuming 'ball' has a property 'position' that dictates its horizontal position
    // This function reduces the position value, simulating a movement to the left
    if (!leftmost(ball)) { // Check if the ball is not at the leftmost position
        ball.position -= 1;
        return `Move ball to position ${ball.position}`;
    } 
    return `Ball is at the leftmost position and cannot move left.`;
}

function moveRight(ball) {
    // Assuming 'ball' has a property 'position'
    // This function increases the position value, simulating a movement to the right
    if (!rightmost(ball)) { // Check if the ball is not at the rightmost position
        ball.position += 1;
        return `Move ball to position ${ball.position}`;
    }
    return `Ball is at the rightmost position and cannot move right.`;
}

// Predicates to check the position of the ball
function leftmost(ball) {
    // Assuming 'ball' has a 'position' and 'minPosition' attributes
    // Returns true if the ball's position is at the minimal allowed value (leftmost wall)
    return ball.position <= ball.minPosition;
}

function rightmost(ball) {
    // Assuming 'ball' has a 'position' and 'maxPosition' attributes
    // Returns true if the ball's position is at the maximum allowed value (rightmost wall)
    return ball.position >= ball.maxPosition;
}

// Example usage, assuming ball object's structure
let ball = {
    position: 5,
    minPosition: 0,
    maxPosition: 10
};

console.log(moveLeft(ball));  // Move left if possible
console.log(leftmost(ball));  // Check if at leftmost position
console.log(moveRight(ball)); // Move right if possible
console.log(rightmost(ball)); // Check if at rightmost position
```

**Notes on Implementation:**
1. The functions `moveLeft` and `moveRight` respectively decrement and increment the `position` of the `ball` if it's not already at the respective edges (leftmost or rightmost).
2. The predicates `leftmost` and `rightmost` check whether the `ball` is at its minimum or maximum positional limits.
3. This implementation assumes that the ball's position and its limits (`minPosition` and `maxPosition`) are numeric and directly modifiable.

### Adjustments Depending on API Details
This example assumes direct manipulation of the ball's position. If the actual system API encapsulates the ball's state differently (e.g., through method calls or event dispatching), you might need to adjust the implementation to fit those specific API interactions.
