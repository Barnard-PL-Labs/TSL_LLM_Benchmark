In JavaScript, given the API constraints and task descriptions, we can implement the functions and predicates as follows:

### Functions

1. `moveLeft(ball)`: This function should modify the `ball` signal to represent moving the ball to the left.
2. `moveRight(ball)`: Similarly, this function should modify the `ball` signal to indicate that the ball should move to the right.

### Predicates

1. `leftmost(ball)`: This predicate checks if the `ball` is currently at the leftmost wall.
2. `rightmost(ball)`: This predicate checks if the `ball` is at the rightmost wall.

Here's the JavaScript implementation:

```javascript
// Functions
function moveLeft(ball) {
    // Assuming 'ball' can take a signal or state that represents its position.
    // This function sets that state to indicate a movement to the left.
    // Example: decrementing the x-position of the ball.
    return ball - 1;
}

function moveRight(ball) {
    // Similar to moveLeft, but increments the position to move right.
    return ball + 1;
}

// Predicates
function leftmost(ball) {
    // Assuming there's a defined constant or a way to determine the leftmost position.
    // Check if the ball's current position is equal to the leftmost boundary.
    // Assuming `LEFTMOST_POSITION` is a constant holding the value of the leftmost position.
    return ball === LEFTMOST_POSITION;
}

function rightmost(ball) {
    // Assuming there's a defined constant or a way to determine the rightmost position.
    // Check if the ball's current position is equal to the rightmost boundary.
    // Assuming `RIGHTMOST_POSITION` is a constant holding the value of the rightmost position.
    return ball === RIGHTMOST_POSITION;
}
```

### Assumptions and Constants
The above implementation assumes that the `ball` variable holds a numerical value representing its position and that there are predefined constants `LEFTMOST_POSITION` and `RIGHTMOST_POSITION` which define the boundaries within the system. Adjust these constants based on the actual system configuration and the maximum/minimum values that `ball` can have.

This implementation is simplistic and does not cover how the values are updated in a real-time environment (e.g., a game loop or an event-driven system). For such cases, additional logic to handle state updates, collision detection, and possibly user input would be necessary.
