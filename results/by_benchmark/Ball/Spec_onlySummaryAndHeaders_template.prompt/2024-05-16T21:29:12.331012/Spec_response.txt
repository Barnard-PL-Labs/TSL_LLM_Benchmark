To translate the given natural language description into a TSL specification, we need to consider the dynamic motion of the ball bouncing between two walls and how it interacts with the boundaries. We will set up TSL code to represent the movement logic and boundary conditions based on the functions and predicates provided.

```tsl
always assume {
  // Assuming that the ball can only be at the leftmost or rightmost position as a starting condition
  (leftmost(ball) || rightmost(ball));
}

always guarantee {
  // When the ball is at the leftmost position, it should move right until it reaches the rightmost position
  leftmost(ball) -> ([ball <- moveRight(ball)] W rightmost(ball));

  // When the ball is at the rightmost position, it should move left until it reaches the leftmost position
  rightmost(ball) -> ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)] W leftmost(ball));
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Assumptions**:
    - The ball starts either at the leftmost or rightmost position. This simplifies the initial condition and focuses on the movement between these extremes.

2. **Guarantees**:
    - If the ball is at the leftmost position, the `moveRight` function is applied to the ball cell repeatedly until the ball reaches the rightmost wall, where `rightmost(ball)` becomes true.
    - Conversely, if the ball is at the rightmost position, the `moveLeft` function is applied to the ball cell repeatedly until the ball reaches the leftmost wall, where `leftmost(ball)` becomes true.

This TSL code captures the bouncing behavior of the ball between the two walls, ensuring that it changes direction appropriately upon reaching each boundary.
