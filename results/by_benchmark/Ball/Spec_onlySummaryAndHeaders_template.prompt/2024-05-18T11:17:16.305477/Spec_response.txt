Based on the provided natural language description and the list of functions and predicates, here is the TSL specification for a ball bouncing between two walls:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Basic conditions and exclusions are not explicitly mentioned in the description,
  // so we assume basic logical consistency and environmental constraints.
}

always guarantee {
  // When the ball is at the leftmost position, the next action should be to move right.
  leftmost(ball) -> X ([ball <- moveRight(ball)]);

  // When the ball is at the rightmost position, the next action should be to move left.
  rightmost(ball) -> X ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)]);

  // If the ball is not at either boundary, continue moving in the current direction.
  // This assumes some mechanism to track current direction, not detailed in the description.
  // Implementation depends on additional context or requires assumption of a direction state.
}
```

Note:
- The specification assumes that the ball will only be at boundary positions (leftmost or rightmost). Moving between positions is abstracted as simply issuing move commands without detailing intermediate positions.
- The transitions between moving left and right are managed by evaluating whether the ball has hit a boundary.
- A direction tracking mechanism might be necessary for a complete implementation, which isn't covered by the given predicates and functions. This mechanism would determine the direction to move when the ball is not at a boundary. For simplicity and based on the description, this isn't included in the specification.
- The assume block is left empty because the environment's specifics (like possible interruptions, speed factors, etc.) are not detailed in the description.
