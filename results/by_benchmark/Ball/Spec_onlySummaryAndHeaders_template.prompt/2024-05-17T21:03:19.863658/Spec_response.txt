To translate your description into a TSL specification, we would need to create assumptions and guarantees that reflect the behavior of a ball bouncing between two walls, with positions represented numerically from 0 to 10. Here is how you might write that:

```
always assume {
  // The state of the ball is either moving left or moving right
  ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)] || [ball <- moveRight(ball)]);

  // When the ball reaches the leftmost position, it cannot move further left
  (leftmost(ball) -> (X [ball <- moveRight(ball)]));

  // When the ball reaches the rightmost position, it cannot move further right
  (rightmost(ball) -> (X [ball <- moveLeft(ball)]));
}

always guarantee {
  // When the ball is not at the leftmost position, it can continue to move left unless it becomes leftmost
  (!leftmost(ball)) -> X ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)] W leftmost(ball));

  // When the ball is not at the rightmost position, it can continue to move right unless it becomes rightmost
  (!rightmost(ball)) -> X ([ball <- moveRight(ball)] W rightmost(ball));

  // If the ball reaches the leftmost wall, it should begin moving right
  leftmost(ball) -> X ([ball <- moveRight(ball)]);

  // If the ball reaches the rightmost wall, it should begin moving left
  rightmost(ball) -> X ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)]);
}
```

This specification captures the bouncing behavior of the ball, where it moves left until hitting the leftmost wall and then switches direction to move right, continuing until it hits the rightmost wall and then goes left again. The `X` (next) operator is used to specify what should happen in the state following the current one, ensuring the ball reverses direction upon hitting either wall. The `W` (weak until) operator ensures that the ball continues moving in a direction until it reaches the wall.
