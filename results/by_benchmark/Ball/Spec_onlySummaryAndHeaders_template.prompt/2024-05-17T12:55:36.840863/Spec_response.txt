Here is the TSL specification based on the description provided for a ball bouncing between two walls, using the given predicates and functions:

```tsl
always assume {
  // No specific assumptions about environment are needed for this scenario
}

always guarantee {
  // If the ball is at the leftmost position, it should start moving right
  leftmost(ball) -> [ball <- moveRight(ball)];

  // If the ball is at the rightmost position, it should start moving left
  rightmost(ball) -> [ball <- moveLeft(ball)];
}
```

This TSL specification handles the state changes needed for a ball bouncing between two boundaries defined by `leftmost` and `rightmost`. When the ball is at the edge, it toggles the direction by applying the appropriate function to change its state (`moveLeft` or `moveRight`).
