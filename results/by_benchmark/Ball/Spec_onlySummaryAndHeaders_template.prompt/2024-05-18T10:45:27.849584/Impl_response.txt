Since we are dealing with a system environment that manipulates a cell representing the state of a ball, we will implement the JavaScript functions and predicates as described. Assuming the API allows manipulating the position of the ball and checking its boundary constraints, here are the JavaScript implementations:

### Functions:
1. **moveLeft(ball)**: This function should move the ball to the left. Assuming the `ball` object has a method or property that allows modifying its position, this could be implemented by decrementing its position value.
2. **moveRight(ball)**: Similar to `moveLeft`, but incrementing the position value to move the ball to the right.

### Predicates:
1. **leftmost(ball)**: This predicate checks if the ball is against the leftmost wall. This can be implemented by checking if the ball's position is at the minimum boundary.
2. **rightmost(ball)**: Checks if the ball is against the rightmost wall by verifying if the ball's position is at the maximum boundary.

### Implementation in JavaScript:
```javascript
// Ball simulation environment
class Ball {
    constructor() {
        this.position = 0; // starting position
        this.minPosition = -10; // leftmost boundary
        this.maxPosition = 10; // rightmost boundary
    }

    // Function to move the ball to the left
    moveLeft() {
        if (this.position > this.minPosition) {
            this.position--;
        }
        return this.position;
    }

    // Function to move the ball to the right
    moveRight() {
        if (this.position < this.maxPosition) {
            this.position++;
        }
        return this.position;
    }

    // Predicate to check if the ball is at the leftmost position
    leftmost() {
        return this.position === this.minPosition;
    }

    // Predicate to check if the ball is at the rightmost position
    rightmost() {
        return this.position === this.maxPosition;
    }
}

// Example usage:
const ball = new Ball();

// Moving the ball
console.log("Initial Position:", ball.position);
ball.moveRight();
ball.moveRight();
console.log("Position after moving right:", ball.position);

// Checking boundaries
console.log("Is at rightmost?", ball.rightmost());
ball.moveLeft();
console.log("Position after moving left:", ball.position);
console.log("Is at leftmost?", ball.leftmost());
```

### Explanation:
1. **Ball Class**: Defines the `Ball` object, initializing it with positional properties and boundary limits.
2. **moveLeft() and moveRight() Methods**: Modifies the `position` of the ball within the defined boundaries.
3. **leftmost() and rightmost() Methods**: Return a boolean indicating whether the ball is at one of the boundary positions.

This setup is a simple simulation of the ball's movement and boundary checking based on the provided API and requirements. Adjust the boundaries and logic as necessary based on additional details from the actual system environment.
