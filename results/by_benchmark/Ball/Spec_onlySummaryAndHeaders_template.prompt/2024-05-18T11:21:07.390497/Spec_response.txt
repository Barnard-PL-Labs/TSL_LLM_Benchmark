To model the behavior of a ball bouncing between two walls using the provided predicates and functions in a TSL specification, we need to define assumptions and guarantees that accurately reflect the movement and boundary conditions:

### TSL Specification for Bouncing Ball

```tsl
always assume {
  // Basic assumption that the ball must always be between the two walls (inclusively)
  (ball >= 0 && ball <= 10);
}

always guarantee {
  // When the ball hits the leftmost wall, it should move right in the next state
  leftmost(ball) -> X ([ball <- moveRight(ball)]);

  // When the ball hits the rightmost wall, it should move left in the next state
  rightmost(ball) -> X ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)]);

  // As long as the ball is not at either wall, it should continue moving in its current direction
  (!leftmost(ball) && !rightmost(ball)) -> (
    ([ball <- moveRight(ball)] W rightmost(ball)) ||
    ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)] W leftmost(ball))
  );
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Assumptions**:
  - The assumption block ensures the ball is always between positions 0 and 10, inclusively. This assumption is inherent based on the natural language description.

- **Guarantees**:
  - If the ball is at the leftmost position (`leftmost(ball)` is true), the next action (`X` operator) must make the ball move right ([ball <- moveRight(ball)]).
  - If the ball is at the rightmost position (`rightmost(ball)`), the next action must make the ball move left ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)]).
  - When the ball is not at either boundary, it should continue moving in the current direction until it hits a wall. This is modeled using the weak until (`W`) operator, ensuring that the ball continues moving in one direction until the condition of reaching the opposite wall is met.

This TSL specification thus captures the bouncing behavior of the ball between the two walls, ensuring that it reversibly switches direction upon hitting each wall.
