To implement the described functions and predicates in JavaScript according to the API details you've provided, you can use the following code examples. These examples assume that the environment or library implicitly understands how to interpret the signals `moveLeft` and `moveRight`, as well as the predicates `leftmost` and `rightmost`.

### Functions

1. **moveLeft(ball)**
   - This function will return a signal to move the ball to the left.
   ```javascript
   function moveLeft(ball) {
       return 'moveLeft';
   }
   ```

2. **moveRight(ball)**
   - This function will return a signal to move the ball to the right.
   ```javascript
   function moveRight(ball) {
       return 'moveRight';
   }
   ```

### Predicates

1. **leftmost(ball)**
   - This predicate checks if the ball is at the leftmost position. It returns a boolean indicating whether the ball is against the leftmost wall. Assuming this condition can be checked by some property or method in the environment (e.g., `ball.atLeftWall`).
   ```javascript
   function leftmost(ball) {
       // Assuming ball has a method or property to check if it is at the leftmost position
       return ball.atLeftWall();
   }
   ```

2. **rightmost(ball)**
   - This predicate checks if the ball is at the rightmost position. Similar to `leftmost`, it returns true if the ball is against the rightmost wall.
   ```javascript
   function rightmost(ball) {
       // Assuming ball has a method or property to check if it is at the rightmost position
       return ball.atRightWall();
   }
   ```

### Notes

- These implementations assume the ball object (or similar context) provides the necessary methods or properties to check its position relative to the walls (`atLeftWall` and `atRightWall`).
- The signals for movement (`moveLeft` and `moveRight`) are simple string returns based on your API description. In a real-world scenario, these might need to interface with actual methods or API calls that can affect the state of the ball in its environment.
- If the ball’s position or status is part of a larger framework or game engine, you might need to integrate these functions more closely with the engine’s update loop or event handling system.

This basic implementation can be adapted or extended based on additional details or constraints of the system in which you're working.
