Given the system environment and requirements, here is a JavaScript implementation of the functions and predicates for managing the movement of a "ball" cell. This example assumes the existence of some kind of environment where these functions are applicable, and that "ball" is an appropriate object or identifier in this context.

### JavaScript Implementation

```javascript
// Function to move the ball to the left
function moveLeft(ball) {
    // Assuming ball is an object with a method to update its position
    ball.move(-1);  // move left by decreasing the position value
    return "Signal to move left";  // returns a signal/message
}

// Function to move the ball to the right
function moveRight(ball) {
    // Assuming ball is an object with a method to update its position
    ball.move(1);  // move right by increasing the position value
    return "Signal to move right";  // returns a signal/message
}

// Predicate to check if the ball is against the leftmost wall
function leftmost(ball) {
    // Assuming there's a method to get the ball's position and a constant for the leftmost position
    return ball.getPosition() === ball.minPosition;  // returns true if the ball is at the leftmost position
}

// Predicate to check if the ball is against the rightmost wall
function rightmost(ball) {
    // Assuming there's a method to get the ball's position and a constant for the rightmost position
    return ball.getPosition() === ball.maxPosition;  // returns true if the ball is at the rightmost position
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **moveLeft and moveRight Functions**:
   - These functions assume `ball` is an object that can be manipulated through a method like `move()`, where passing a negative value moves the ball left and a positive value moves it right.
   - Each function returns a string that acts as a "signal", this could be integrated into a broader system where such signals are meaningful (e.g., logging, event handling).

2. **leftmost and rightmost Predicates**:
   - These functions check if `ball` is at its minimum or maximum position, respectively. This assumes the `ball` object has methods to get its current position (`getPosition()`) and predefined constants (`minPosition`, `maxPosition`) that define the boundaries of its movement.
   - They return a boolean indicating whether the ball is at the respective boundary.

### Usage in an Environment:

This implementation assumes the existence of a specific environment where the `ball` object and its methods (`move()`, `getPosition()`, etc.) are predefined. The functions and predicates here are designed to interact with this environment, making them dependent on the system's API and the properties of the `ball` object. For a real-world application, further integration and testing would be necessary to ensure compatibility and functionality within the system.
