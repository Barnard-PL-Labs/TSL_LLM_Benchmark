Here is the TSL specification based on the description given:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Assume the logical exclusivity of being at either wall
  !(leftmost(ball) && rightmost(ball));
}

always guarantee {
  // When the ball is at the leftmost wall, it must move right next
  leftmost(ball) -> X ([ball <- moveRight(ball)]);

  // When the ball is at the rightmost wall, it must move left next
  rightmost(ball) -> X ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)]);
  
  // When the ball is not at any wall, it continues in its current direction
  // This assumes that the ball's movement direction is encoded in the state of 'ball'
  !leftmost(ball) && !rightmost(ball) -> X ([ball <- ball]);
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions**:
   - The ball can't be at both the leftmost and rightmost positions simultaneously, which logically shouldn't occur.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - If the ball is at the leftmost position (`leftmost(ball)`), in the next state, the ball should move right (`[ball <- moveRight(ball)]`).
   - If the ball is at the rightmost position (`rightmost(ball)`), in the next state, the ball should move left (`[ball <- moveLeft(ball)]`).
   - If the ball is not at any wall, it retains its current state or continues in the direction it was previously moving. This is based on the current 'ball' state, which should encode its direction implicitly.

This specification ensures that the ball bounces between the walls by changing direction upon hitting each wall and continues to move in the same direction while it's in between.
