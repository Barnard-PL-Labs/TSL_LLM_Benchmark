Here is a TSL specification for the scenario described:

```tsl
always assume {
  // The ball can only be at the leftmost or rightmost position, but not both at the same time
  !(leftmost(ball) && rightmost(ball));
}

always guarantee {
  // When the ball is at the leftmost position, it must move right in the next state
  leftmost(ball) -> X [ball <- moveRight(ball)];
  
  // When the ball is at the rightmost position, it must move left in the next state
  rightmost(ball) -> X [ball <- moveLeft(ball)];
  
  // Ensure the ball moves left until it hits the leftmost wall
  // and moves right until it hits the rightmost wall
  G ((leftmost(ball) -> (F rightmost(ball))) && (rightmost(ball) -> (F leftmost(ball))));
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Assumptions**:
   - The ball cannot be at both the leftmost and the rightmost positions simultaneously. This ensures logical consistency in the environment's behavior.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - If the ball is at the leftmost position (`leftmost(ball)`), the next action (`X`) should be to move it right (`[ball <- moveRight(ball)]`).
   - Conversely, if the ball is at the rightmost position (`rightmost(ball)`), the next action should be to move it left (`[ball <- moveLeft(ball)]`).
   - The ball's movement is governed by a continuous loop bouncing between the two walls. Once at a wall, it must eventually reach the other wall and vice versa, creating an ongoing bounce effect (`G ((leftmost(ball) -> (F rightmost(ball))) && (rightmost(ball) -> (F leftmost(ball))))`).

This TSL specification captures the bouncing dynamics of the ball between two set points, defining not just the immediate reactions but also the long-term behavior expected of the ball in this environment.
