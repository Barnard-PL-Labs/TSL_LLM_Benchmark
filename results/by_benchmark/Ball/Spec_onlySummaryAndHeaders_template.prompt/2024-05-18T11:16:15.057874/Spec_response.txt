To translate the given natural language description into TSL, we need to define assumptions and guarantees that manage the ball's movement between two walls. The ball's behavior should ensure it bounces back and forth between the boundaries represented by positions 0 and 10.

### TSL Specification

```tsl
always assume {
  // Assumption on ball positioning; ball should only be at the extremes when it can move towards the opposite direction
  (leftmost(ball) -> !rightmost(ball)) ;
  (rightmost(ball) -> !leftmost(ball)) ;
}

always guarantee {
  // If the ball is at the leftmost position, it should move right on the next state
  leftmost(ball) -> X [ball <- moveRight(ball)];
  
  // If the ball is at the rightmost position, it should move left on the next state
  rightmost(ball) -> X [ball <- moveLeft(ball)];
  
  // When the ball is not at any wall, it continues in the current direction
  !leftmost(ball) && !rightmost(ball) -> [ball <- ball];
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Assumptions**: 
   - The ball should only be at the leftmost position if it is not simultaneously at the rightmost position, and vice versa. This ensures logical consistency in the ball's position.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - If the ball is at the leftmost position (`leftmost(ball)`), the next action (`X`) should be to move the ball right (`moveRight(ball)`).
   - If the ball is at the rightmost position (`rightmost(ball)`), the next action should be to move the ball left (`moveLeft(ball)`).
   - When the ball is not at either boundary, it retains its current position or state (`ball <- ball`), implying continued motion in its current direction until it reaches a boundary.

This TSL specification models a simple system where a ball bounces between two boundaries, reflecting the physical behavior described in the natural language prompt.
