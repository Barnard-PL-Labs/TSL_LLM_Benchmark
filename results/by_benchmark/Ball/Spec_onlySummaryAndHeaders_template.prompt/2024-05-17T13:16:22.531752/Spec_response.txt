To translate your natural language description into a TSL specification, we will outline both the assumptions about the behavior of the ball and the environment, as well as the guarantees that should be met based on those assumptions. Here's how it can be structured:

```TSL
always assume {
    // assuming ball can only be at the leftmost or the rightmost or somewhere in between
    (leftmost(ball) || rightmost(ball));
}

always guarantee {
    // when the ball hits the leftmost wall, it should move right
    leftmost(ball) -> X ([ball <- moveRight(ball)]);

    // when the ball hits the rightmost wall, it should move left
    rightmost(ball) -> X ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)]);
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Assumptions**:
    - `leftmost(ball) || rightmost(ball)`: This assumption simplifies the situation by only considering cases where the ball is directly at either wall. Although the ball moves through intermediate positions between the walls, those positions don't need explicit handling in this specific logic due to how we model the behavior at the boundaries.

2. **Guarantees**:
    - `leftmost(ball) -> X ([ball <- moveRight(ball)])`: If the ball is at the leftmost position (`leftmost(ball)`), then in the next state (`X`), the ball should be instructed to move right (`moveRight(ball)`). This captures the bounce behavior when hitting the left wall.
    - `rightmost(ball) -> X ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)])`: Similarly, if the ball is at the rightmost position, then in the next state, the ball should be instructed to move left, modeling the bounce from the right wall.

This TSL code ensures that the ball will alternately bounce between the two sides, adhering to the physical behavior of a ball bouncing in a bounded corridor.
