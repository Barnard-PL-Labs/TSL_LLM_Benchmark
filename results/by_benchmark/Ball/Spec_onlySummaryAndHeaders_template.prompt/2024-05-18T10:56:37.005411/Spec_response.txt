Here is the TSL specification for the scenario where a ball is bouncing between two walls, using the provided cells, functions, and predicates.

```tsl
always assume {
  // It's either against the left wall, somewhere in the middle, or against the right wall.
  (leftmost(ball) || !leftmost(ball) && !rightmost(ball) || rightmost(ball));
}

always guarantee {
  // If the ball is against the leftmost wall, it should start moving right
  leftmost(ball) -> [ball <- moveRight(ball)];
  
  // If the ball is against the rightmost wall, it should start moving left
  rightmost(ball) -> [ball <- moveLeft(ball)];

  // If not at the boundaries, it should continue in the current direction until it hits a wall
  (!leftmost(ball) && !rightmost(ball)) -> ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)] W rightmost(ball) || [ball <- moveRight(ball)] W leftmost(ball));
}
```

This specification ensures that:
- If the ball is at the leftmost wall, it receives a signal to move to the right.
- If the ball is at the rightmost wall, it receives a signal to move to the left.
- When the ball is somewhere in between, it continues to move in the current direction until it reaches one of the walls, transitioning the movement direction at the boundaries.
