Here is a TSL specification that models a ball bouncing between two walls, based on the provided functions, predicates, and rules:

```tsl
always assume {
  // ensure the ball is only at the leftmost or rightmost position or any position in between
  (leftmost(ball) || rightmost(ball) || (!leftmost(ball) && !rightmost(ball)));
}

always guarantee {
  // if the ball is at the leftmost wall, it should move right on the next state
  leftmost(ball) -> X ([ball <- moveRight(ball)]);
  
  // if the ball is at the rightmost wall, it should move left on the next state
  rightmost(ball) -> X ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)]);
  
  // if the ball is not at any wall, continue moving in the current direction
  (!leftmost(ball) && !rightmost(ball)) -> ([ball <- moveRight(ball)] W leftmost(ball));
  (!leftmost(ball) && !rightmost(ball)) -> ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)] W rightmost(ball));
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions**:
   - The `always assume` block makes sure the ball is only in one of three states: at the leftmost position, at the rightmost position, or somewhere in between. Although the numeric representation is not directly modeled in TSL, the predicates `leftmost(ball)` and `rightmost(ball)` implicitly handle the boundary conditions.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - If the ball is against the leftmost wall (`leftmost(ball)`), the next state must have the ball moving to the right (`[ball <- moveRight(ball)]`).
   - If the ball is against the rightmost wall (`rightmost(ball)`), the next state must command the ball to move left (`[ball <- moveLeft(ball)]`).
   - If the ball is currently not at any wall, it continues moving in its current direction until it hits a wall. This is modeled by using a weak until (`W`) to keep the ball moving in the current direction until it reaches a wall.

This model ensures that the ball bounces between the two boundaries, adhering to the rules of a simple bouncing ball physics model within the context of a TSL specification.
