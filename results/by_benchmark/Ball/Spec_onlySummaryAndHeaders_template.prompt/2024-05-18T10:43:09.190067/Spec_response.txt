To translate the natural language description into a TSL specification, you need to consider how the ball interacts with its environment and how the system reacts to these interactions. The TSL specification will capture the behavior of the ball as it bounces between two walls, with the position of the ball ranging from 0 to 10.

Here is the TSL specification for the described scenario:

```tsl
always assume {
  // The ball can only be at the leftmost or rightmost position, or moving between them
  (leftmost(ball) -> X !leftmost(ball));
  (rightmost(ball) -> X !rightmost(ball));
}

always guarantee {
  // If the ball is at the leftmost position, it should move right
  leftmost(ball) -> [ball <- moveRight(ball)];
  
  // If the ball is at the rightmost position, it should move left
  rightmost(ball) -> [ball <- moveLeft(ball)];
  
  // If the ball is not at either boundary, it continues in the same direction it was moving
  !(leftmost(ball) || rightmost(ball)) -> (G ((ball = moveRight(ball)) || (ball = moveLeft(ball))));
}
```
Explanation:
1. **Assumptions**:
   - When the ball is at the leftmost position (`leftmost(ball)`), the next state cannot be `leftmost(ball)` again, indicating the ball moves away from this position.
   - Similarly, when the ball is at the rightmost (`rightmost(ball)`), the next state ensures it moves away from this boundary.
   
2. **Guarantees**:
   - If the ball is at the leftmost position, the next command sent to the ball is to move it right (`moveRight(ball)`).
   - If the ball is at the rightmost position, the next command is to move it left (`moveLeft(ball)`).
   - For positions between the walls where the ball is neither at the leftmost nor the rightmost, the ball continues in its last set movement direction, either continuing moving right or left. This is captured using the global operator `G`, ensuring the ball maintains its direction until it hits a wall.

This specification ensures that the ball bounces back and forth between the two walls, respecting the boundaries and changing direction accordingly.
