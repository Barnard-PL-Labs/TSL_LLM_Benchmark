To translate your natural language description into a TSL specification that models a ball bouncing between two walls, we need to handle the movement of the ball based on its position and how it interacts with the boundaries (walls) at positions 0 and 10. Here is how this can be organized into a TSL specification:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Assumption about the boundaries
  (leftmost(ball) -> (ball.position == 0)) ;
  (rightmost(ball) -> (ball.position == 10)) ;
}

always guarantee {
  // Guarantee describing the bouncing behavior of the ball
  // When the ball is at the leftmost position, it should move right
  leftmost(ball) -> X ([ball.position <- moveRight(ball)]) ;

  // When the ball is at the rightmost position, it should move left
  rightmost(ball) -> X ([ball.position <- moveLeft(ball)]) ;

  // Normal movement: if not at any boundary, retain current moving direction
  // Assuming that the direction is toggled when it hits the walls
  (!leftmost(ball) && !rightmost(ball))
    -> X ([ball.position <- (moveRight(ball) || moveLeft(ball))]) ;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions**:
   - Establishes that if the `ball` is `leftmost`, its position must be 0.
   - If the `ball` is `rightmost`, its position is 10.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - If the `ball` is at the leftmost wall (position 0), in the next state (`X`), the ball's position should update to move to the right (`moveRight(ball)`).
   - If the ball is at the rightmost wall (position 10), in the next state, it should start moving to the left (`moveLeft(ball)`).
   - In the normal case where the ball is not at any wall, it should continue moving in the current direction, which is either left or right. Here, it's either `moveRight(ball)` or `moveLeft(ball)`; this simplifies the model and assumes that the movement function knows which direction to continue based on some internal state or previous direction.

This specification models a simple bouncing ball constrained by two walls at positions 0 and 10, with the ball switching directions when it reaches either boundary.
