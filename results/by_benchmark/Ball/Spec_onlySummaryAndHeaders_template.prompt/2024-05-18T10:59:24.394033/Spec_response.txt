To represent the behavior of a ball bouncing between two walls in a TSL specification, we need to define the assumptions about the ball's movements and guarantee the correct responses based on its position. Here is a complete TSL specification following the given predicates and functions:

```tsl
always assume {
  (ball = 0 -> leftmost(ball));   // When the ball's position is 0, it is at the leftmost wall
  (ball = 10 -> rightmost(ball)); // When the ball's position is 10, it is at the rightmost wall
  (ball >= 0 && ball <= 10);      // The ball's position is always between 0 and 10
}

always guarantee {
  (leftmost(ball) -> X ([ball <- moveRight(ball)]));  // When at the leftmost wall, move the ball to the right next
  (rightmost(ball) -> X ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)]));  // When at the rightmost wall, move the ball to the left next

  // Ensure that when not at either wall, the ball continues in the same direction it was moving
  (!leftmost(ball) && !rightmost(ball) && (ball > 0 && ball < 10)) -> (
    (ball' = ball + 1 -> X ([ball <- moveRight(ball)])) ||
    (ball' = ball - 1 -> X ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)]))
  );
}
```

In this TSL specification:
- The `always assume` block defines the logical conditions concerning the ball's position in relation to the walls and ensures that the ball's position stays within the defined range (0 to 10).
- The `always guarantee` block manages the movement of the ball:
  - If the ball is at the leftmost wall (position 0), it moves right in the next state.
  - If the ball is at the rightmost wall (position 10), it moves left in the next state.
  - If the ball is not at any wall, it continues to move in the direction it was previously moving, provided it is still within the valid range.

This specification ensures the ball bounces correctly between the two boundaries.
