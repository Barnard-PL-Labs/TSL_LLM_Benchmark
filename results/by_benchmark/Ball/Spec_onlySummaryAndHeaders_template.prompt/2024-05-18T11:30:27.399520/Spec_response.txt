To create a TSL specification for the described scenario where a ball bounces between two walls, we need to define the logic which governs how the ball should move based on its position. We will use the functions `moveLeft(ball)` and `moveRight(ball)` to change the ball's direction and the predicates `leftmost(ball)` and `rightmost(ball)` to detect when the ball hits the walls.

Here is the TSL specification based on the provided description:

```TSL
always assume {
  // Assume basic functionality of predicates and functions, no further assumptions needed
}

always guarantee {
  // When the ball hits the leftmost wall, it should start moving to the right
  leftmost(ball) -> [ball <- moveRight(ball)];

  // When the ball hits the rightmost wall, it should start moving to the left
  rightmost(ball) -> [ball <- moveLeft(ball)];

  // Ensure that when neither boundary condition is met, the ball continues in its current direction
  !(leftmost(ball) || rightmost(ball)) -> ([ball <- ball]);
}
```

In this specification:
- The `always assume` block is left with a comment only, as there are no additional assumptions specified for the context of this problem.
- The `always guarantee` block specifies the behavior of the ball when it is at the boundaries (leftmost and rightmost positions). It also ensures that if the ball is not at any boundary, it maintains its current state, which implicitly continues its last commanded direction of movement. The actual logic for the direction is abstracted in the functions `moveLeft` and `moveRight` which will handle how the ball's position is updated.
