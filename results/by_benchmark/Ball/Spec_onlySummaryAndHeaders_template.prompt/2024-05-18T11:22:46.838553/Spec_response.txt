To convert the description of a ball bouncing between two walls into a TSL specification, consider how the ball should react depending on its position relative to either wall. The function `moveLeft(ball)` moves the ball to the left when triggered and `moveRight(ball)` moves it to the right. The predicates `leftmost(ball)` and `rightmost(ball)` indicate when the ball is at either the leftmost or rightmost extremity, respectively. 

Here is the TSL specification that describes this behavior:

```tsl
always assume {
  // These predicates manage the state of the ball's position on the edges
  (leftmost(ball) -> (!rightmost(ball))) ;
  (rightmost(ball) -> (!leftmost(ball))) ;
}

always guarantee {
  // If the ball is at the rightmost position, move it left
  rightmost(ball) -> [ball <- moveLeft(ball)];

  // If the ball is at the leftmost position, move it right
  leftmost(ball) -> [ball <- moveRight(ball)];

  // When the ball is not at any wall, continue moving in the current direction
  (!leftmost(ball) && !rightmost(ball)) -> ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)] W rightmost(ball) || [ball <- moveRight(ball)] W leftmost(ball));
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions**:
   - When the ball is at the leftmost point (`leftmost(ball)`), it cannot be at the rightmost point, and vice versa. These mutual exclusivity assumptions ensure logical consistency in the ball's position.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - If the ball reaches the rightmost wall (`rightmost(ball)`), the next action should be to move it left (`moveLeft(ball)`).
   - Conversely, if it's at the leftmost wall (`leftmost(ball)`), then it should be moved right (`moveRight(ball)`).
   - When the ball isn't touching either wall, it should keep moving in the current direction until it hits a wall. This is represented by the usage of the weak until operator (`W`), allowing the ball to keep moving left until it hits the rightmost wall or keep moving right until it hits the leftmost wall. 

This TSL specification captures the continuous back-and-forth motion of a ball between two boundaries, reflecting its bouncing behavior.
