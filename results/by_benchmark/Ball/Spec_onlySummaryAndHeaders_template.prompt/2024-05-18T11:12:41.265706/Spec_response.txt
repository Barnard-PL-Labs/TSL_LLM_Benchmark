To create a TSL specification reflecting the behavior of a ball bouncing between two walls, we need to translate the natural language description into appropriate TSL assume and guarantee blocks. Here's how you can specify it:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Assumptions about the ball's state when it reaches the leftmost or rightmost wall
  (leftmost(ball) -> X (!leftmost(ball))); // Next state, not on the leftmost if just there
  (rightmost(ball) -> X (!rightmost(ball))); // Next state, not on the rightmost if just there
}

always guarantee {
  // The ball bounces between two walls
  leftmost(ball) -> X [ball <- moveRight(ball)]; // Move right when at leftmost
  rightmost(ball) -> X [ball <- moveLeft(ball)]; // Move left when at rightmost

  // Ensure the ball moves continuously left or right if not at the walls
  (!leftmost(ball) && !rightmost(ball))
    -> (([ball <- moveLeft(ball)] W rightmost(ball)) || ([ball <- moveRight(ball)] W leftmost(ball)));
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions**:
    - If the ball is at the leftmost position, in the next state, it cannot still be at the leftmost. This ensures that the ball moves away from the wall.
    - Similarly, if the ball is at the rightmost position, in the next state, it must move away from this wall too.

2. **Guarantees**:
    - When the ball reaches the leftmost wall (`leftmost(ball)`), in the next state, it should move right. The function `moveRight(ball)` handles this movement.
    - When the ball reaches the rightmost wall (`rightmost(ball)`), in the next state, it should move left. The function `moveLeft(ball)` is used here.
    - When the ball is not at any wall, it should continuously move in its current direction either until it hits a wall. This is controlled by the weak until (`W`) operator, allowing the ball to keep moving in one direction (left or right) until it reaches the opposite wall.

This TSL specification captures the continuous bouncing behavior of the ball between two defined boundaries (walls), with direct actions to change direction upon hitting each wall.
