The specified TSL for the scenario where you act as an arbiter for trucks crossing a bridge can be drafted as follows:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Assumptions that each truck will eventually make a request to go across the bridge
  F (r 1);
  F (r 2);
  F (r 3);
  F (r 4);
}

always guarantee {
  // Guarantees that if a truck makes a request, it will eventually be granted access
  (r 1) -> F ([ g <- 1 ]);
  (r 2) -> F ([ g <- 2 ]);
  (r 3) -> F ([ g <- 3 ]);
  (r 4) -> F ([ g <- 4 ]);

  // Additional guarantees based on coin flips and grants:
  // 1. If 3 wins the coinflip against 1 and 2 is granted, then 3 must not be granted until 1 is
  (p 3 1) && ([ g <- 2 ]) -> !([ g <- 3 ]) W [ g <- 1 ];

  // 2. If 1 wins the coinflip against 3 and 2 is granted, then 1 must not be granted until 3 is
  (p 1 3) && ([ g <- 2 ]) -> !([ g <- 1 ]) W [ g <- 3 ];

  // 3. If truck 4 is granted, 1 must not be granted until 2 is
  ([ g <- 4 ]) -> !([ g <- 1 ]) W [ g <- 2 ];

  // 4. If 4 wins the coinflip against 2 and 3 is granted, then 4 must not be granted until 2 is
  (p 4 2) && ([ g <- 3 ]) -> !([ g <- 4 ]) W [ g <- 2 ];

  // 5. If 1 wins the coinflip against 4 and 3 is granted, then 1 must not be granted until 4 is
  (p 1 4) && ([ g <- 3 ]) -> !([ g <- 1 ]) W [ g <- 4 ];
}
```

This TSL specification encapsulates the rules and conditions under which the trucks are allowed to cross the bridge based on their requests and outcomes of coin flips, ensuring that the bridge is shared fairly and according to the specified constraints.
