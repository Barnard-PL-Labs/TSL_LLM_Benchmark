To implement the function `updateState` in JavaScript based on the provided description and constraints, we need to consider several factors. 

The function should:
1. Check which trucks are requesting to cross the bridge.
2. Decide which truck gets granted access based on the requests and specified rules.
3. Ensure that the conditions mentioned are respected (mutual exclusion, coinflip condition).

Here's a possible implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
function updateState({ currentState, cells, predicates }) {
    // Extract cells and predicates for easier reference
    let { g } = cells;
    const { r, p } = predicates;

    // Determine the requesting trucks
    let requestingTrucks = [];
    for (let i = 1; i <= 4; i++) {
        if (r(i)) {
            requestingTrucks.push(i);
        }
    }

    // Decide which truck to grant access to:
    // Only one truck can be on the bridge at a time, so we choose one truck from the requesting list.
    let grantedTruck = null;

    if (requestingTrucks.length > 0) {
        // If some trucks are requesting access, choose one based on a simple arbiter logic (first come, first served for simplicity)
        // But we also must respect the coinflip rule:
        // "if 1 wins the coinflip against 2 and 3 is granted, then 1 must not be granted until 2 is"
        if (p(1, 2) && g === 3) {
            // If truck 1 wins the coinflip against 2 and 3 is currently granted,
            // truck 1 must not be granted until truck 2 is granted.
            let index1 = requestingTrucks.indexOf(1);
            let index2 = requestingTrucks.indexOf(2);

            if (index1 !== -1 && index2 !== -1) {
                // Both truck 1 and 2 are requesting
                grantedTruck = 2; // Grant truck 2 to comply with the rule
            } else if (index2 !== -1) {
                // Only truck 2 is requesting
                grantedTruck = 2; 
            } else {
                // Default to the first available truck that is not truck 1
                grantedTruck = requestingTrucks.find(truck => truck !== 1) || null;
            }
        } else {
            // Regular granting, first come first served
            grantedTruck = requestingTrucks[0];
        }
    }

    // Update the cell 'g' to be the index of the truck that is granted a request to go across the road
    g = grantedTruck;

    // Return updated state
    return {
        currentState,
        cells: { g },
        predicates
    };
}
```
This function starts by identifying which trucks are requesting to cross the bridge. It then decides which truck to grant based on the requests and the additional condition related to the coinflip scenario. The truck that gets access is stored in the `g` cell.

The function structure assumes the presence of `cells` and `predicates` objects to manage the bridge crossing state and logic, respectively. Keep in mind that this implementation simplifies the decision process and focuses primarily on the provided constraints. In a real-world scenario, additional considerations such as priority, timing, and safety might be required.
