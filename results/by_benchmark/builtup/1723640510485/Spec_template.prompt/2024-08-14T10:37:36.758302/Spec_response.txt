Based on the provided description and requirements for the system managing trucks crossing a bridge, the TSL specification can be structured as follows:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Assumptions about truck requests
  F (r 1);
  F (r 2);
  F (r 3);
  F (r 4);
}

always guarantee {
  // Guarantees that if a truck makes a request, it will eventually be granted access
  r 1 -> F ([ g <- 1 ]);
  r 2 -> F ([ g <- 2 ]);
  r 3 -> F ([ g <- 3 ]);
  r 4 -> F ([ g <- 4 ]);

  // Additional guarantees based on coinflip outcomes and grants
  (p 1 2 && [ g <- 3 ]) -> (!([ g <- 1 ]) W [ g <- 2 ]);
  (p 1 2 && [ g <- 4 ]) -> (!([ g <- 1 ]) W [ g <- 2 ]);
  (p 1 3 && [ g <- 2 ]) -> (!([ g <- 1 ]) W [ g <- 3 ]);
  (p 1 3 && [ g <- 4 ]) -> (!([ g <- 1 ]) W [ g <- 3 ]);
  (p 1 4 && [ g <- 2 ]) -> (!([ g <- 1 ]) W [ g <- 4 ]);
  (p 1 4 && [ g <- 3 ]) -> (!([ g <- 1 ]) W [ g <- 4 ]);
  (p 2 1 && [ g <- 3 ]) -> (!([ g <- 2 ]) W [ g <- 1 ]);
  (p 2 1 && [ g <- 4 ]) -> (!([ g <- 2 ]) W [ g <- 1 ]);
  (p 2 3 && [ g <- 1 ]) -> (!([ g <- 2 ]) W [ g <- 3 ]);
  (p 2 3 && [ g <- 4 ]) -> (!([ g <- 2 ]) W [ g <- 3 ]);
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Assumptions**:
    - Each truck (`i` from 1 to 4) will eventually make a request to cross the bridge (`r i`), represented using `F (r i)` which indicates that it will "finally" (at some point in the future) occur.

2. **Guarantees**:
    - Each truck that requests to cross the bridge will eventually be granted access, denoted by `r i -> F ([ g <- i ])`. This means if truck `i` requests (`r i`), then it is eventually guaranteed (`F`) that it will be granted access (`[ g <- i ]`).

3. **Additional Guarantees Based on Coinflips**:
    - Rules like `(p 1 2 && [ g <- 3 ]) -> (!([ g <- 1 ]) W [ g <- 2 ])` capture conditions where, if truck 1 wins a coinflip against truck 2 and truck 3 is granted access (`[ g <- 3 ]`), truck 1 (`[ g <- 1 ]`) should not be granted until truck 2 is granted (`[ g <- 2 ]`). This uses the weak until operator (`W`) which waits for the second condition to become true while the first condition holds.

This TSL script ensures that the arbitration system behaves correctly according to the specified rules, managing the access to the bridge in a fair and orderly manner based on requests and outcomes of coinflips between trucks.
