To implement the functions and predicates described using JavaScript, we can start by defining the functions and ensuring that they adhere to the specifications. Given that we don't have a specific API to interact with, I'll assume basic functionalities like setting and getting the value of a cell, and generating a random outcome for a coinflip. Here's a possible implementation:

### JavaScript Implementation

```javascript
// Assuming an API with basic functionalities
const system = {
    setCell: (cellName, value) => {
        // Sets the value of a cell
        this[cellName] = value;
    },
    getCell: (cellName) => {
        // Gets the value of a cell
        return this[cellName];
    },
    request: (truckId) => {
        // Simulate whether a truck is requesting to go across the road
        // This should be replaced with actual implementation or API call
        return Math.random() > 0.5;
    },
    coinFlip: () => {
        // Simulate a coin flip
        return Math.random() > 0.5;
    }
};

// Functions and Predicates

/**
 * Sets the `g` cell to the index of the truck that is granted a request to go across the road in this timestep.
 * @param {number} truckId - ID of the truck granted request.
 */
function grantRequestToTruck(truckId) {
    system.setCell('g', truckId);
}

/**
 * Evaluates if truck `i` is requesting to go across the road in this timestep.
 * @param {number} truckId - ID of the truck.
 * @returns {boolean} - True if the truck is requesting, false otherwise.
 */
function r(truckId) {
    return system.request(truckId);
}

/**
 * Returns true if truck `i` wins the coinflip against truck `j`.
 * @param {number} truckI - ID of truck i.
 * @param {number} truckJ - ID of truck j.
 * @returns {boolean} - Result of the coin flip.
 */
function p(truckI, truckJ) {
    // Assuming the coin flip is fair and independent of the truck IDs
    // Return true if truckI wins, false if truckJ wins
    return system.coinFlip();
}

// Usage Example
const truck1 = 1;
const truck2 = 2;

if (r(truck1) && r(truck2)) {
    if (p(truck1, truck2)) {
        console.log(`Truck ${truck1} wins the coinflip and can go across the road.`);
        grantRequestToTruck(truck1);
    } else {
        console.log(`Truck ${truck2} wins the coinflip and can go across the road.`);
        grantRequestToTruck(truck2);
    }
}
```

### Explanation
1. **System API**: We assumed a minimal `system` object that can manage cell values and simulate requests and coin flips. In a real application, these would interact with actual system hardware or software components.
2. **grantRequestToTruck**: This function sets the `g` cell to the ID of the truck that is granted the request.
3. **r(truckId)**: This predicate checks if a specific truck is requesting to cross the road.
4. **p(truckI, truckJ)**: This predicate performs a coin flip to decide between two trucks.

The above code should be adapted to the real API calls and environment for full functionality.
