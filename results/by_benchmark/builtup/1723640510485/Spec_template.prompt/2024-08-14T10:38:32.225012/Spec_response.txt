Here is how you can translate the given natural language description into a TSL specification:

```TSL
always assume {
  // Assuming every truck i in 1..4 will eventually make a request to go across the bridge
  F (r 1) ;
  F (r 2) ;
  F (r 3) ;
  F (r 4) ;
}

always guarantee {
  // Guarantees for each truck i in 1..4, if truck i makes a request to go across the bridge, eventually it will be granted access
  (r 1) -> F ([ g <- 1 ]) ;
  (r 2) -> F ([ g <- 2 ]) ;
  (r 3) -> F ([ g <- 3 ]) ;
  (r 4) -> F ([ g <- 4 ]) ;

  // Additional guarantees based on coin flip outcomes and grants
  ((p 1 2) && [ g <- 3 ]) -> !([ g <- 1 ]) W [ g <- 2 ] ;
  ((p 1 2) && [ g <- 4 ]) -> !([ g <- 1 ]) W [ g <- 2 ] ;

  ((p 1 3) && [ g <- 2 ]) -> !([ g <- 1 ]) W [ g <- 3 ] ;
  ((p 1 3) && [ g <- 4 ]) -> !([ g <- 1 ]) W [ g <- 3 ] ;

  ((p 1 4) && [ g <- 2 ]) -> !([ g <- 1 ]) W [ g <- 4 ] ;
  ((p 1 4) && [ g <- 3 ]) -> !([ g <- 1 ]) W [ g <- 4 ] ;

  ((p 2 1) && [ g <- 3 ]) -> !([ g <- 2 ]) W [ g <- 1 ] ;
  ((p 2 1) && [ g <- 4 ]) -> !([ g <- 2 ]) W [ g <- 1 ] ;

  ((p 2 3) && [ g <- 1 ]) -> !([ g <- 2 ]) W [ g <- 3 ] ;
  ((p 2 3) && [ g <- 4 ]) -> !([ g <- 2 ]) W [ g <- 3 ] ;
}
```

This TSL specification encompasses the requirements:

- The assumptions section guarantees that each truck will eventually make a request to cross the bridge.
- The guarantee section ensures that once a request is made by a truck, it will eventually be granted access to cross the bridge.
- The additional guarantees enforce rules based on the outcomes of coin flips between trucks and current grants, ensuring that the order of granting access respects the results of these coin flips.
