A system environment has the following API. Using the API, implement the following methods in JavaScript. The methods are divided into two categories, "functions" and "predicates". "functions" can be arbitrary functions, but "predicates" always return a boolean.

Functions and predicates to implement:

Cells:
    "g" is a cell that is set to the index of the truck that is granted a request to go across the road in this timestep
Predicates:
    (r i) => this evaluates to true when truck "i" is requesting to go across the road in this timestep
    (p i j) => this returns true if truck "i" wins the coinflip against truck "j". this does not have any particular meaning, other than that two trucks have chosen to flip a coin against one another because they are bored.

System API:


/* There is no wrapper api */
