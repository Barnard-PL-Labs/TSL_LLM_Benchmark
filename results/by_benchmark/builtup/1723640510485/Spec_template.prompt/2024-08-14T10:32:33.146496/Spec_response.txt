Here is the TSL specification based on the given natural language description and the structure of TSL code:

```tsl
always assume {
  F (r 1);
  F (r 2);
  F (r 3);
  F (r 4);
}

always guarantee {
  r 1 -> F ([g <- 1]);
  r 2 -> F ([g <- 2]);
  r 3 -> F ([g <- 3]);
  r 4 -> F ([g <- 4]);

  (p 1 2 && [g <- 3]) -> !([g <- 1]) W [g <- 2];
  (p 1 2 && [g <- 4]) -> !([g <- 1]) W [g <- 2];
  (p 1 3 && [g <- 2]) -> !([g <- 1]) W [g <- 3];
  (p 1 3 && [g <- 4]) -> !([g <- 1]) W [g <- 3];
  (p 1 4 && [g <- 2]) -> !([g <- 1]) W [g <- 4];
  (p 1 4 && [g <- 3]) -> !([g <- 1]) W [g <- 4];
  (p 2 1 && [g <- 3]) -> !([g <- 2]) W [g <- 1];
  (p 2 1 && [g <- 4]) -> !([g <- 2]) W [g <- 1];
  (p 2 3 && [g <- 1]) -> !([g <- 2]) W [g <- 3];
  (p 2 3 && [g <- 4]) -> !([g <- 2]) W [g <- 3];
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Assumptions**: Each truck (1 through 4) will eventually make a request to go across the bridge. The `F (r i)` assumes that at some future point, each truck `i` will request to cross the bridge.

2. **Guarantees**: For each truck `i` making a request `r i`, it is guaranteed that eventually `[g <- i]` this truck will be given the grant to cross the bridge.

3. **Specific guarantees regarding coinflips**:
    - Statements like `(p 1 2 && [g <- 3]) -> !([g <- 1]) W [g <- 2]` ensure that if truck 1 wins a coinflip against truck 2 and truck 3 is granted the access, truck 1 will not be granted access until truck 2 is granted.

This specification captures both the requests and the arbitration process to grant access to the bridge, ensuring that only one truck crosses at a time and honoring the additional condition based on the outcome of coinflips.
