Below is the TSL specification based on the given description and constraints for managing truck crossings on a bridge.

```tsl
always assume {
    for i in 1..4 {
        F (r i); // Eventually, each truck i will make a request to go across the bridge
    }
}

always guarantee {
    for i in 1..4 {
        (r i) -> F ([g <- i]); // If truck i makes a request, eventually it will be granted access
    }

    // Specific coinflip and granting conditions
    (p 1 2) && ([g <- 3]) -> !([g <- 1]) W ([g <- 2]);
    (p 1 2) && ([g <- 4]) -> !([g <- 1]) W ([g <- 2]);
    (p 1 3) && ([g <- 2]) -> !([g <- 1]) W ([g <- 3]);
    (p 1 3) && ([g <- 4]) -> !([g <- 1]) W ([g <- 3]);
    (p 1 4) && ([g <- 2]) -> !([g <- 1]) W ([g <- 4]);
    (p 1 4) && ([g <- 3]) -> !([g <- 1]) W ([g <- 4]);
    (p 2 1) && ([g <- 3]) -> !([g <- 2]) W ([g <- 1]);
    (p 2 1) && ([g <- 4]) -> !([g <- 2]) W ([g <- 1]);
    (p 2 3) && ([g <- 1]) -> !([g <- 2]) W ([g <- 3]);
    (p 2 3) && ([g <- 4]) -> !([g <- 2]) W ([g <- 3]);
}
```

Explanation:
- The `always assume` block states that eventually each truck will request to cross the bridge. This is represented by `F (r i)`.
- The `always guarantee` block ensures that each truck's request to cross the bridge is eventually granted (`(r i) -> F ([g <- i])`).
- Additional guarantees cover specific scenarios where if truck `i` wins a coin flip against truck `j` and another truck `k` is granted access, truck `i` will not be granted until truck `j` is granted. This ensures that only one truck is on the bridge at a time, in line with the description of trucks taking turns to cross the bridge.
