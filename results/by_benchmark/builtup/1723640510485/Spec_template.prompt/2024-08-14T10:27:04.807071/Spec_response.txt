Below is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description, with assumptions and guarantees to fulfill the requirements for the operation of trucks crossing a bridge:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Assumption: Each truck will eventually make a request to go across the bridge
  F (r 1);
  F (r 2);
  F (r 3);
  F (r 4);
}

always guarantee {
  // Guarantee: If a truck makes a request, eventually it will be granted access to the bridge
  (r 1) -> F ([ g <- 1 ]);
  (r 2) -> F ([ g <- 2 ]);
  (r 3) -> F ([ g <- 3 ]);
  (r 4) -> F ([ g <- 4 ]);

  // Additional guarantees as specified
  // 1. if 1 wins the coinflip against 2 and 3 is granted, then 1 must not be granted until 2 is
  ((p 1 2) && ([ g <- 3 ])) -> (![ g <- 1 ] W [ g <- 2 ]);

  // 2. if 1 wins the coinflip against 2 and 4 is granted, then 1 must not be granted until 2 is
  ((p 1 2) && ([ g <- 4 ])) -> (![ g <- 1 ] W [ g <- 2 ]);

  // 3. if 1 wins the coinflip against 3 and 2 is granted, then 1 must not be granted until 3 is
  ((p 1 3) && ([ g <- 2 ])) -> (![ g <- 1 ] W [ g <- 3 ]);

  // 4. if 1 wins the coinflip against 3 and 4 is granted, then 1 must not be granted until 3 is
  ((p 1 3) && ([ g <- 4 ])) -> (![ g <- 1 ] W [ g <- 3 ]);

  // 5. if 1 wins the coinflip against 4 and 2 is granted, then 1 must not be granted until 4 is
  ((p 1 4) && ([ g <- 2 ])) -> (![ g <- 1 ] W [ g <- 4 ]);

  // 6. if 1 wins the coinflip against 4 and 3 is granted, then 1 must not be granted until 4 is
  ((p 1 4) && ([ g <- 3 ])) -> (![ g <- 1 ] W [ g <- 4 ]);

  // 7. if 2 wins the coinflip against 1 and 3 is granted, then 2 must not be granted until 1 is
  ((p 2 1) && ([ g <- 3 ])) -> (![ g <- 2 ] W [ g <- 1 ]);

  // 8. if 2 wins the coinflip against 1 and 4 is granted, then 2 must not be granted until 1 is
  ((p 2 1) && ([ g <- 4 ])) -> (![ g <- 2 ] W [ g <- 1 ]);

  // 9. if 2 wins the coinflip against 3 and 1 is granted, then 2 must not be granted until 3 is
  ((p 2 3) && ([ g <- 1 ])) -> (![ g <- 2 ] W [ g <- 3 ]);

  // 10. if 2 wins the coinflip against 3 and 4 is granted, then 2 must not be granted until 3 is
  ((p 2 3) && ([ g <- 4 ])) -> (![ g <- 2 ] W [ g <- 3 ]);
}
```

This TSL specification attempts to capture the behavior of trucks crossing a bridge with an arbiter granting access based on requests and additional rules involving coinflips between trucks. Each truck eventually makes a request to cross the bridge, and if a request is made, the truck is eventually granted access based on the conditions specified. The additional rules ensure that the order of granting access respects the outcomes of coinflips among different trucks.
