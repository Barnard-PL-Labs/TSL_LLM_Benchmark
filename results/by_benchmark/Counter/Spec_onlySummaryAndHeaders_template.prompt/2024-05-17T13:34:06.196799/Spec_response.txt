To convert the given description into a TSL specification, we need to define conditions for each button press and its effect on the counter's step size. We also need to ensure mutual exclusion between these operations, meaning no two buttons can be pressed at the same time. Here is the TSL code based on the provided predicates, functions, and cells:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure that no two buttons are pressed at the same time.
  !(pressA(e) && pressB(e));
  !(pressA(e) && pressC(e));
  !(pressB(e) && pressC(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // When A is pressed three times consecutively, stepsize is multiplied by three
  // unless B or C is pressed, which resets the stepsize to 1.
  pressA(e) -> (
    X pressA(e) -> (
      X pressA(e) -> [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)] W (pressB(e) || pressC(e))
    )
  );
  
  // When B or C is pressed, reset the stepsize to 1.
  (pressB(e) || pressC(e)) -> [stepsize <- 1];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Mutual Exclusion**: The `always assume` block ensures that no two buttons can be pressed simultaneously. This is crucial to prevent overlapping operations that could lead to undefined behaviors.

2. **Button A Logic**: 
   - The nested temporal logic checks that if `pressA(e)` is true, then in the next state `pressA(e)` should again be true, and then once more (`X pressA(e)`). If this sequence occurs, the stepsize is multiplied by three using the function `multiplyByThree(stepsize)`.
   - The `W` weak until operator ensures that this multiplication occurs only if neither button B nor C is pressed during this sequence. If either B or C is pressed, the sequence is interrupted, and the stepsize is reset to 1.

3. **Button B and C Logic**:
   - If either button B or C is pressed, the counter's stepsize is immediately reset to 1. This is a straightforward operation indicated by the direct assignment in the `always guarantee` block.

This setup meets the specification given in the natural language description, handling the counter increment adjustments based on the button interactions specified.
