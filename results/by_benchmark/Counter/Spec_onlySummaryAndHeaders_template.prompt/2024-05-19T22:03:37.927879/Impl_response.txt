To implement the given requirements in JavaScript, you'll need to create the necessary functions and predicates as described. Since the description doesn't provide a specific API method for handling key presses, we'll assume that the key state can be checked by accessing properties of an event object `e` for simplicity. Below is the JavaScript implementation for the functions and predicates, handling the scenario described:

```javascript
// Initialize the stepsize cell with a default value of 1
let stepsize = 1;

// Function to multiply the stepsize by 3
function multiplyByThree(stepsize) {
    return stepsize * 3;
}

// Predicate to check if the 'a' key was pressed
function pressA(e) {
    return e.key === 'a';
}

// Predicate to check if the 'b' key was pressed
function pressB(e) {
    return e.key === 'b';
}

// Predicate to check if the 'c' key was pressed
function pressC(e) {
    return e.key === 'c';
}

// Example usage within an event listener
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(e) {
    if (pressA(e)) {
        console.log(`'a' key was pressed. Incrementing counter by stepsize: ${stepsize}`);
        // Code to increment the counter by stepsize
    }

    if (pressB(e)) {
        console.log(`'b' key was pressed. Resetting stepsize to 1`);
        stepsize = 1; // Reset stepsize to 1 on pressing 'b'
    }

    if (pressC(e)) {
        console.log(`'c' key was pressed. Multiplying stepsize by 3.`);
        stepsize = multiplyByThree(stepsize); // Multiply stepsize by 3 on pressing 'c'
    }
});
```

### Explanation:
1. **Stepsize Initialization**: The variable `stepsize` is initialized to 1 at the start of the program.

2. **multiplyByThree Function**: This function takes `stepsize` as input and returns its value multiplied by 3.

3. **Predicates (pressA, pressB, pressC)**: These functions take an event object `e` and check if the 'a', 'b', or 'c' key was pressed, respectively.

4. **Event Listener**: An event listener is added to the document to listen for keydown events. Depending on which key is pressed, different actions are performed:
   - If 'a' is pressed, it reports and can increment a counter by the current `stepsize`.
   - If 'b' is pressed, it resets `stepsize` to 1.
   - If 'c' is pressed, it multiplies `stepsize` by 3 using the `multiplyByThree` function.

This setup assumes that the keys 'a', 'b', and 'c' correspond to specific actions as per the predicates defined. Adjustments might be necessary based on the actual handling of key events in the environment where this script will be used.
