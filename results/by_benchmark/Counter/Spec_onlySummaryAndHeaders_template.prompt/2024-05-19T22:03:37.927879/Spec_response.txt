Here's the TSL specification based on the description provided:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure mutual exclusion among button presses
  ! (pressA(e) && pressB(e));
  ! (pressA(e) && pressC(e));
  ! (pressB(e) && pressC(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Reset stepsize to 1 if B or C is pressed
  (pressB(e) || pressC(e)) -> [stepsize <- 1];
  
  // Pressing A increments the counter by current stepsize; after three consecutive A presses, multiply stepsize by 3
  pressA(e) -> (
    [e <- e + stepsize] &&
    (X pressA(e) -> (
      [e <- e + stepsize] &&
      (X pressA(e) -> (
        [e <- e + stepsize] &&
        X [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)]
      ))
    ))
  );
  
  // Pressing B increments the counter by 2
  pressB(e) -> [e <- e + 2];
  
  // Pressing C increments the counter by 3
  pressC(e) -> [e <- e + 3];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Mutual Exclusion**: The assumptions ensure that no two button presses (`A`, `B`, or `C`) can occur simultaneously. This is critical to avoid conflicts in updating the counter (`e`) and the step size (`stepsize`).

2. **Counter Operations**:
   - **Press A**: The guarantee when pressing key `A` increments the counter by the current `stepsize`. If `A` is pressed three consecutive times, the `stepsize` is then multiplied by three after the third press. If either `B` or `C` is pressed in between, the sequence resets (handled by the reset of `stepsize` to 1).
   - **Press B**: Simply increments the counter by 2.
   - **Press C**: Simply increments the counter by 3.

3. **Resetting Stepsize**: Whenever `B` or `C` is pressed, the `stepsize` is reset to 1 to ensure that the multiplicative effect on pressing `A` three times is correctly reset.
