Here's the TSL specification based on the description provided:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensures no two button presses happen simultaneously
  !(pressA(e) && pressB(e));
  !(pressA(e) && pressC(e));
  !(pressB(e) && pressC(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Pressing A increments the counter by stepsize, which starts at 1
  pressA(e) -> ([counter <- counter + stepsize]);
  
  // If A is pressed three times consecutively without B or C being pressed, multiply stepsize by 3
  G((pressA(e) && X(pressA(e)) && X(X(pressA(e)))) -> 
    (X(X(X (stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)))) W (pressB(e) || pressC(e))));
  
  // Pressing B increments the counter by 2 and resets stepsize to 1
  pressB(e) -> ([counter <- counter + 2] && [stepsize <- 1]);
  
  // Pressing C increments the counter by 3 and resets stepsize to 1
  pressC(e) -> ([counter <- counter + 3] && [stepsize <- 1]);
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Assumptions**:
   - We ensure that no two buttons can be pressed simultaneously using mutual exclusion in the assumptions.
   
2. **Guarantees**:
   - **pressA(e)**: Each time the 'A' key is pressed, the counter is incremented by the current stepsize.
   - **Sequence of A key presses**: If 'A' is pressed three times in a row without interruptions from 'B' or 'C', stepsize is multiplied by three after the third press. This change holds until either 'B' or 'C' is pressed.
   - **pressB(e)**: Pressing 'B' increments the counter by 2 and resets stepsize to 1.
   - **pressC(e)**: Pressing 'C' increments the counter by 3 and resets stepsize to 1.

This TSL specification accurately represents the rules and behaviors described in the natural language description for handling the pressing of keys 'A', 'B', and 'C'.
