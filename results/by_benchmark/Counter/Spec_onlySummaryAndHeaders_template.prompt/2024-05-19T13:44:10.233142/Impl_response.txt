To implement the required methods as described in JavaScript, we first need to understand how to interact with the given cells "stepsize" and "e". A typical approach would be to assume that these cells are accessible and modifiable within the JavaScript environment. We'll be creating functions `multiplyByThree` and predicates `pressA`, `pressB`, and `pressC` according to the requirements.

Here is how you can implement these functions and predicates in JavaScript:

```javascript
// This variable represents the state of the 'stepsize' cell.
let stepsize = 1;  // Default value for the demonstration. This should be set according to your system's implementation.

// This variable represents the state of the 'e' cell.
let e = { aPressed: false, bPressed: false, cPressed: false };  // A simulated state object for demonstration.

/**
 * Function to multiply the stepsize by 3.
 * @param {number} stepsize - The current value of stepsize.
 * @returns {number} - The stepsize multiplied by 3.
 */
function multiplyByThree(stepsize) {
    return stepsize * 3;
}

/**
 * Predicate to check if the 'a' key was pressed.
 * @param {object} e - The event object containing the state of keys.
 * @returns {boolean} - True if the 'a' key was pressed, false otherwise.
 */
function pressA(e) {
    return e.aPressed;
}

/**
 * Predicate to check if the 'b' key was pressed.
 * @param {object} e - The event object containing the state of keys.
 * @returns {boolean} - True if the 'b' key was pressed, false otherwise.
 */
function pressB(e) {
    return e.bPressed;
}

/**
 * Predicate to check if the 'c' key was pressed.
 * @param {object} e - The event object containing the state of keys.
 * @returns {boolean} - True if the 'c' key was pressed, false otherwise.
 */
function pressC(e) {
    return e.cPressed;
}

// Example usage:
console.log("Multiply stepsize by 3:", multiplyByThree(stepsize));
console.log("Was 'a' pressed?", pressA(e));
console.log("Was 'b' pressed?", pressB(e));
console.log("Was 'c' pressed?", pressC(e));

// Simulating a key press
e.aPressed = true;
console.log("Was 'a' pressed after update?", pressA(e));
```

### Notes:
1. **Variables `stepsize` and `e`** are placeholders and need to be integrated depending on how your system stores or passes these states.
2. **Modify the cell states**: The example above assumes you can directly modify the state of `e` (e.g., `e.aPressed = true`). In a real-world application, this might be done through event listeners or other mechanisms depending on how user input is handled in your system.
3. **Integration with the actual environment**: The above implementation is a standalone JavaScript code. Integrate it with your actual environment, ensuring that the way cells and events are managed in your system is properly addressed.
