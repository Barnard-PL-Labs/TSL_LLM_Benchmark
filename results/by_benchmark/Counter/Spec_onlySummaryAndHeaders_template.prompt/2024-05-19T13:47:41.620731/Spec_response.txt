To translate the given natural language description into a TSL specification, we will set up assumptions and guarantees in line with the description of the behavior of pressing A, B, and C keys and how they affect the `stepsize` value. We will also ensure that no two operations can be performed at the same time, implying mutual exclusion among the key presses.

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure mutual exclusion between pressing A, B, and C
  !(pressA(e) && pressB(e));
  !(pressA(e) && pressC(e));
  !(pressB(e) && pressC(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // If A is pressed three times consecutively, multiply stepsize by 3, unless interrupted by B or C
  pressA(e) -> (
    [counter <- counter + stepsize] W (
      pressB(e) || pressC(e) || 
      (pressA(e) -> (
        [counter <- counter + stepsize] W (
          pressB(e) || pressC(e) || 
          (pressA(e) -> (
            [counter <- counter + stepsize];
            [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)] W (pressB(e) || pressC(e))
          ))
        ))
      ))
    );
    
  // If B or C is pressed, reset the stepsize to 1
  (pressB(e) || pressC(e)) -> [stepsize <- 1];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions**:
   - Mutual exclusivity is assumed between the operations of pressing A, B, and C to enforce that no two button presses occur at the same time.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - When A is pressed, the counter is incremented by the current `stepsize`. This operation waits (`W` operator) for either B or C to be pressed to break the sequence or for A to be pressed again.
   - If A is pressed sequentially three times without interruption by B or C, after each press the counter is incremented, and then the `stepsize` is multiplied by three.
   - Pressing B or C resets the `stepsize` to 1, ensuring that any sequence involving A is reset when either B or C is pressed.

This TSL specification captures the behavior described in the natural language, appropriately handling the sequential and conditional logic associated with button presses and their impact on the counter and `stepsize`.
