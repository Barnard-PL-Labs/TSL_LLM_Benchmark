Based on the provided natural language description and the functions and predicates that you've listed, here's a TSL specification encapsulating the button-press scenario with the stepsize modifications:

```tsl
always assume {
    // Ensure that no two counter operations can be performed at the same time
    !(pressA(e) && pressB(e));
    !(pressA(e) && pressC(e));
    !(pressB(e) && pressC(e));
}

always guarantee {
    // When pressing the A key three times consecutively, multiply the stepsize by three
    // unless B or C is pressed which resets stepsize to 1
    (pressA(e) && X(pressA(e)) && X(X(pressA(e)))) && !(X(pressB(e)) || X(pressC(e)) || X(X(pressB(e))) || X(X(pressC(e)))) 
        -> [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)];

    // Reset the stepsize to 1 if B or C is pressed
    (pressB(e) || pressC(e)) 
        -> [stepsize <- 1];

    // Default behavior when A is pressed under normal circumstances (not three times consecutively without interruption)
    pressA(e) && !(X(pressA(e)) && X(X(pressA(e))))
        -> [stepsize <- stepsize];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions:**
   - The `always assume` block ensures that no two counter operations (i.e., button presses) can occur simultaneously. This means that `pressA(e)`, `pressB(e)`, and `pressC(e)` are mutually exclusive at any given time.

2. **Guarantees:**
   - The `always guarantee` block specifies the behavior of the system in reaction to button presses:
     - When the A key is pressed three consecutive times without either the B or C key being pressed in between or immediately following, the stepsize is multiplied by three (`multiplyByThree(stepsize)`). This is ensured by checking both the immediate (`X()`) and the second immediate (`X(X())`) future states.
     - If the B or C key is pressed, the stepsize is reset to 1.
     - If the A key is pressed but not three times consecutively or interrupted by B or C presses, the stepsize remains unchanged, ensuring that regular presses without specified conditions do not alter the stepsize unexpectedly.
     
This TSL specification fulfills the described logical behavior regarding the interaction of button presses and changes to the `stepsize` cell based on specified conditions.
