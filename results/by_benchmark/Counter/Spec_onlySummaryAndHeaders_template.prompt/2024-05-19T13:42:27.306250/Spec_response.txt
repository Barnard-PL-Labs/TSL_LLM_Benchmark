Here is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description and the functions and predicates:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure mutual exclusion among button presses
  !(pressA(e) && pressB(e));
  !(pressA(e) && pressC(e));
  !(pressB(e) && pressC(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // When A is pressed three times consecutively without B or C being pressed in between, stepsize is multiplied by 3
  (pressA(e) && X (pressA(e)) && X X (pressA(e))) && !(X(pressB(e)) || X(pressC(e)) || X X(pressB(e)) || X X(pressC(e))) 
    -> [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)];

  // When B or C is pressed, reset stepsize to 1
  (pressB(e) || pressC(e)) -> [stepsize <- 1];
  
  // Default behavior: keep stepsize unchanged unless specified
  ! (pressA(e) || pressB(e) || pressC(e)) -> [stepsize <- stepsize];
}
```

Explanation:

1. **Assumptions**: We ensure that no two button presses can occur simultaneously, preventing any overlap of actions that could affect the `stepsize`.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - The `stepsize` is multiplied by three if the A button is pressed three times consecutively, and neither B nor C is pressed in between these presses.
   - If the B or C button is pressed at any time, the `stepsize` is reset to 1.
   - If none of the buttons A, B, or C is pressed, the `stepsize` remains unchanged. This default state ensures the `stepsize` only changes with button interactions as specified.
