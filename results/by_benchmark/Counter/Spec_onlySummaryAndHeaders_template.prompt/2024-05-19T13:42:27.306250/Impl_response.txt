To implement the outlined functions and predicates in JavaScript based on the given API description, we'll assume the minimal setup where the "stepsize" and "e" cells hold values that can be accessed directly. Since "e" is mentioned to be a signal that dictates how a counter behaves, we'll infer that "e" is an object with fields corresponding to the states of different keys.

Hereâ€™s how you can implement these functions and predicates in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Functions

/**
 * Multiplies the step size by three.
 * @param {number} stepsize - The current step size.
 * @return {number} - Returns the step size multiplied by three.
 */
function multiplyByThree(stepsize) {
    return stepsize * 3;
}

// Predicates

/**
 * Checks if the 'a' key was pressed.
 * @param {object} e - The event or state object containing key states.
 * @return {boolean} - Returns true if the 'a' key was pressed.
 */
function pressA(e) {
    return e.a === true;
}

/**
 * Checks if the 'b' key was pressed.
 * @param {object} e - The event or state object containing key states.
 * @return {boolean} - Returns true if the 'b' key was pressed.
 */
function pressB(e) {
    return e.b === true;
}

/**
 * Checks if the 'c' key was pressed.
 * @param {object} e - The event or state object containing key states.
 * @return {boolean} - Returns true if the 'c' key was pressed.
 */
function pressC(e) {
    return e.c === true;
}

// Example usage
let stepsize = 2;
let e = { a: true, b: false, c: true };

console.log("Original stepsize:", stepsize);
console.log("Stepsize after multiplying by three:", multiplyByThree(stepsize));

console.log("Did the user press 'a'? ", pressA(e));
console.log("Did the user press 'b'? ", pressB(e));
console.log("Did the user press 'c'? ", pressC(e));
```

### Notes:
1. The `multiplyByThree` function receives `stepsize` as an argument, multiplies it by 3, and returns the result.
2. Each predicate function (`pressA`, `pressB`, `pressC`) takes an object `e` as its argument. This object `e` is expected to have properties named `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of which should be a boolean indicating whether the corresponding key is pressed.
3. The example usage at the end demonstrates how you can call these functions and predicates to perform operations and checks based on the given setup.

Make sure the structure of the event or state object `e` aligns with the expected keys ('a', 'b', 'c') in the predicate functions for this to work correctly. Adjust the structure based on actual application context or API documentation when integrating with a real system.
