Based on your description, here's how a TSL specification could look for the scenario:

```tsl
always assume {
    // Ensuring that no two button presses can occur at the same time
    !(pressA(e) && pressB(e));
    !(pressA(e) && pressC(e));
    !(pressB(e) && pressC(e));
}

always guarantee {
    // Logic for pressing A, B, or C buttons and their effects on the counter and stepsize
    pressA(e) -> {
      // Increment the counter by the current stepsize value
      [counter <- counter + stepsize];
      // If A is pressed three times consecutively without B or C interrupting, multiply stepsize by 3
      (X (pressA(e) && X (pressA(e) && !(pressB(e) || pressC(e)))))
        -> [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)] W (pressB(e) || pressC(e));
    };
    pressB(e) -> {
      // Increment the counter by 2 and reset stepsize to 1
      [counter <- counter + 2];
      [stepsize <- 1];
    };
    pressC(e) -> {
      // Increment the counter by 3 and reset stepsize to 1
      [counter <- counter + 3];
      [stepsize <- 1];
    };
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions**: We ensure that no two buttons can be pressed at the same time, preventing any simultaneous operations that might otherwise lead to undefined behavior.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - When the **A key** is pressed, the counter is incremented by the current `stepsize`. If the A key is pressed three times consecutively without either the B or C key being pressed in between, the `stepsize` is multiplied by three. This increased `stepsize` continues until either B or C is pressed.
   - When the **B key** is pressed, it increments the counter by 2 and resets the `stepsize` to 1.
   - When the **C key** is pressed, it increments the counter by 3 and resets the `stepsize` to 1.

This TSL specification captures the logic of adjusting the counter based on which button is pressed and manages the `stepsize` according to the rules defined in your scenario.
