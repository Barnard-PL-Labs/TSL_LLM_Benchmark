Here is the TSL specification for the described system where pressing the A key three times in a row multiplies the stepsize by three, while pressing B or C resets the stepsize to 1. We also ensure mutual exclusivity among the A, B, and C key presses.

```tsl
always assume {
    // Ensure that no two button presses happen at the same time
    !(pressA(e) && pressB(e));
    !(pressA(e) && pressC(e));
    !(pressB(e) && pressC(e));
}

always guarantee {
    // Handling the press of A key
    pressA(e) -> {
        [e.counter <- e.counter + stepsize];
        X (pressA(e) -> {
            [e.counter <- e.counter + stepsize];
            X (pressA(e) -> {
                [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)];
                [e.counter <- e.counter + stepsize];
            }) // Reset stepsize if B or C is pressed after two consecutive A presses
            W (pressB(e) || pressC(e))
        }) // Reset stepsize if B or C is pressed after one A press
        W (pressB(e) || pressC(e))
    };

    // Handling the press of B key, resets stepsize to 1
    pressB(e) -> {
        [stepsize <- 1];
        [e.counter <- e.counter + stepsize];
    };

    // Handling the press of C key, also resets stepsize to 1
    pressC(e) -> {
        [stepsize <- 1];
        [e.counter <- e.counter + stepsize];
    };
}
```

Explanation:
- **Assumptions**: We assume mutual exclusion between button presses to ensure that no two operations can occur at the same time.
- **Guarantee (A key)**: When the A key is pressed, the counter is incremented by `stepsize`. If A is pressed again immediately next, the same increment happens. If A is pressed a third time consecutively, `stepsize` is multiplied by three. If at any point B or C is pressed before the third consecutive A press, `stepsize` is reset.
- **Guarantee (B and C keys)**: Pressing either B or C immediately resets `stepsize` to 1 and increments the counter by the new `stepsize`. This also avoids the multiplier effect of consecutive A presses.
