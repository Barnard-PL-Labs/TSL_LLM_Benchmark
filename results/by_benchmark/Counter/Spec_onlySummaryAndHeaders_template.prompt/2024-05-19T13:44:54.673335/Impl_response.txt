To implement the specified functions and predicates using JavaScript, we first need to understand that "cells" like `stepsize` and `e` will be the variables or state values in our JavaScript code. The function `multiplyByThree` will multiply a given value by 3, and predicates will check the state of the variable `e` to determine if certain keys ('a', 'b', 'c') have been pressed. Below are the implementations in JavaScript:

### Functions

```javascript
function multiplyByThree(stepsize) {
    return stepsize * 3;
}
```

### Predicates

For the predicates, since we do not have a direct API for detecting key presses, we need to assume that `e` is an object that captures the state of keyboard events, possibly updated elsewhere in your application. Each property (`pressA`, `pressB`, `pressC`) on `e` might be a boolean that indicates whether the respective key is pressed. If `e` is structured differently, you will need to adjust these functions accordingly.

```javascript
function pressA(e) {
    return e.pressA === true; // Assuming e.pressA is true if 'a' is pressed
}

function pressB(e) {
    return e.pressB === true; // Assuming e.pressB is true if 'b' is pressed
}

function pressC(e) {
    return e.pressC === true; // Assuming e.pressC is true if 'c' is pressed
}
```

### Example Usage

Assuming you have some mechanism to update `e` with the current key press states:

```javascript
let e = {
    pressA: false,
    pressB: false,
    pressC: false
};

// Simulate key press updates
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
    if (event.key === 'a') {
        e.pressA = true;
    } else if (event.key === 'b') {
        e.pressB = true;
    } else if (event.key === 'c') {
        e.pressC = true;
    }
});

document.addEventListener('keyup', function(event) {
    if (event.key === 'a') {
        e.pressA = false;
    } else if (event.key === 'b') {
        e.pressB = false;
    } else if (event.key === 'c') {
        e.pressC = false;
    }
});

// Usage of functions and predicates
const stepsize = 10;
console.log("Stepsize multiplied by three:", multiplyByThree(stepsize));

// Check if 'a' is pressed
if (pressA(e)) {
    console.log("Key 'A' is pressed.");
}
```

### Final Notes

This example is quite schematic and assumes that you are either implementing or have access to a way to keep the `e` object updated based on actual key presses in your environment. The JavaScript `keydown` and `keyup` event listeners here are only a simulation of how you might integrate such functionality. Adjustments may be necessary depending on the actual structure of your application and state management.
