Here is the TSL specification based on the description provided:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure that no two counter operations can be performed simultaneously
  !(pressA(e) && pressB(e));
  !(pressA(e) && pressC(e));
  !(pressB(e) && pressC(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Pressing the A key increments the counter; if pressed three times consecutively, multiplies the size by 3, unless B or C is pressed
  pressA(e) -> ([counter <- counter + stepsize] W (pressB(e) || pressC(e)));

  // Pressing B or C resets the stepsize to 1
  (pressB(e) || pressC(e)) -> [stepsize <- 1];

  // If A key is pressed three times in a row without B or C being pressed, multiply stepsize by 3
  G(pressA(e) && X(pressA(e) && X(pressA(e)))) && !(X(pressB(e) || pressC(e)) || X(X(pressB(e) || pressC(e)))) -> [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions:**
   - The assumption block ensures that no two button presses can happen at the same time, preventing simultaneous counter operations.

2. **Guarantees:**
   - When the A key is pressed: It increments the counter by the current stepsize. This incrementation continues until either B or C key is pressed.
   - When either B or C key is pressed: The stepsize is reset to 1.
   - If the A key is pressed three times consecutively without any presses of B or C in between or immediately after those presses, the stepsize is multiplied by 3. This is achieved by keeping track of three consecutive A presses and checking that neither B nor C follows these presses in the next two states.
