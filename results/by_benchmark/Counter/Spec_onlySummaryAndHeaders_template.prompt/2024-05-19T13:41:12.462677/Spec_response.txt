To translate the described behavior into a TSL specification, we need to reflect the mutual exclusivity of button presses and the effect they have on the counter and `stepsize`. Also, the condition about pressing the A key three times in a row affecting the `stepsize` by multiplying it by three must be accounted for, as well as the reset condition when either B or C keys are pressed. Here's how this could be represented in TSL:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Mutual exclusivity of button presses
  !(pressA(e) && pressB(e));
  !(pressA(e) && pressC(e));
  !(pressB(e) && pressC(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Tracking A key presses and their effect on stepsize
  (pressA(e) && pressA(X e) && pressA(X X e) && !pressB(e) && !pressC(e))
    -> [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)]; // Multiply stepsize by three if A is pressed three times consecutively without B or C being pressed

  // If B or C is pressed, reset stepsize to 1
  (pressB(e) || pressC(e)) -> [stepsize <- 1];

  // Increment counter by stepsize when A is pressed
  pressA(e) -> [counter <- counter + stepsize];

  // Ensure that there is no action on the counter when B or C are pressed alone
  (pressB(e) || pressC(e)) -> [counter <- counter];
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Assumptions** section ensures that no two buttons (A, B, C) are pressed simultaneously, preserving the mutual exclusivity.
2. **Guarantees** section:
   - Tracks three consecutive presses of the A button without interruptions by B or C presses and multiplies the `stepsize` by three.
   - Resets the `stepsize` to 1 whenever B or C is pressed.
   - Increments the `counter` by the current `stepsize` when the A button is pressed.
   - Holds the `counter` constant if either B or C is pressed alone, implying no effect on the counter by these buttons except for potentially resetting the `stepsize`. 

This TSL specification matches the natural language description by structuring the control flow and state changes according to the described button interactions.
