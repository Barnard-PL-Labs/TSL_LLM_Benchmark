```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure that no two key presses can happen at the same time
  !(pressA(e) && pressB(e));
  !(pressA(e) && pressC(e));
  !(pressB(e) && pressC(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // When A is pressed, increment the counter by the current stepsize
  pressA(e) -> ([counter <- counter + stepsize]);

  // When B is pressed, increment the counter by 2 and reset stepsize to 1
  pressB(e) -> ([counter <- counter + 2] && [stepsize <- 1]);

  // When C is pressed, increment the counter by 3 and reset stepsize to 1
  pressC(e) -> ([counter <- counter + 3] && [stepsize <- 1]);

  // If A is pressed three times consecutively without B or C being pressed, multiply stepsize by 3
  (X(pressA(e) && X(pressA(e) && X(pressA(e)))) && !pressB(e) && !pressC(e))
  -> [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)];

  // Reset stepsize to 1 upon starting or pressing B or C
  !(pressA(e) || pressB(e) || pressC(e)) -> [stepsize <- 1];
}
```

In this TSL specification, the `always assume` block establishes mutual exclusivity among the button presses, ensuring that no two actions (pressA, pressB, pressC) can be processed at the same time. The `always guarantee` block outlines the behavior when each button is pressed: incrementing the counter with different values and managing the `stepsize` state. The special condition for the A key being pressed three times consecutively without B or C being pressed is handled to modify the `stepsize` accordingly. The default reset of `stepsize` to 1 is included to ensure it is properly set upon program start or when no relevant key is pressed.
