To translate the provided natural language description into TSL, we need to handle the different scenarios involving button presses and their effects on the counter increment. The TSL will use the predicates for button presses and the functions to manipulate the counter's step size as specified:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure mutual exclusivity between button presses
  !(pressA(e) && pressB(e));
  !(pressA(e) && pressC(e));
  !(pressB(e) && pressC(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // When A is pressed three times consecutively, multiply stepsize by 3
  pressA(e) && X(pressA(e)) && X(X(pressA(e))) && !X(X(X(pressB(e) || pressC(e))))
    -> [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)];

  // If B or C is pressed, reset stepsize to 1
  (pressB(e) || pressC(e))
    -> [stepsize <- 1];

  // Ensure that after pressing A, B, or C, no other button modifies stepsize for that instance
  pressA(e) -> X(!pressA(e) || pressA(e) && !pressB(e) && !pressC(e));
  pressB(e) -> X(!pressB(e));
  pressC(e) -> X(!pressC(e));
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions:**
    - Mutual exclusivity between button presses is enforced. This ensures that no two buttons are pressed simultaneously, reflecting the requirement that no two counter operations can be performed at the same time.

2. **Guarantees:**
    - **A button sequence handling**: The counter's step size is multiplied by three if the A button is pressed three consecutive times, without B or C being pressed immediately after the third A press.
    - **B and C button handling**: Pressing either B or C resets the stepsize to 1, irrespective of previous stepsize values.
    - **State maintenance post-button press**: After pressing any button, ensure the subsequent state does not allow an immediate repeat of another button press that would conflict with the stepsize adjustment logic (this is especially relevant for A due to its multi-press feature). 

This specification ensures that the actions related to pressing A, B, and C are handled appropriately according to the specified requirements, with mutual exclusivity and specific changes to the counter's step size.
