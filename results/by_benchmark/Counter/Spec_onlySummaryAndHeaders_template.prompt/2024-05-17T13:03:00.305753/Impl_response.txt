Below, I provide JavaScript implementations for the functions and predicates mentioned based on the provided API details and system environment:

### Functions
The `multiplyByThree` function takes an input `stepsize` and returns its value multiplied by three. 

```javascript
function multiplyByThree(stepsize) {
    return stepsize * 3;
}
```

### Predicates
The predicates `pressA`, `pressB`, and `pressC` each check if the respective key 'a', 'b', or 'c' has been pressed. Since the exact nature of "e" (how it represents key press states) isn't specified, these implementations assume `e` is an object with properties indicating whether each key is pressed (`true` for pressed, `false` for not pressed). You will need to adapt this if `e` uses a different structure.

```javascript
function pressA(e) {
    return e.a === true;
}

function pressB(e) {
    return e.b === true;
}

function pressC(e) {
    return e.c === true;
}
```

### Note:
- **Adaptation Required**: Ensure that the implementations of `pressA`, `pressB`, and `pressC` match the actual structure of the `e` object used in your system. The provided implementations assume `e` is an object like `{ a: true, b: false, c: false }`, where a property being `true` signifies the corresponding key is pressed. If `e` is structured differently (e.g., using different keys or storing key press states in a different format), you'll need to modify the code accordingly.
- **Testing and Integration**: After implementing these functions and predicates, it is essential to integrate them with your existing codebase and perform thorough testing to ensure they behave as expected within your system's environment.
- **Security and Error Handling**: Consider adding error handling (e.g., checking if `e` has the necessary properties) and other security measures as required by your application's context.
