Here is a TSL specification based on the provided natural language description and the functions, predicates, and cells you've outlined:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Mutually exclusive key presses
  !(pressA(e) && pressB(e));
  !(pressA(e) && pressC(e));
  !(pressB(e) && pressC(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Initial step size is set to 1 at the start
  [stepsize <- 1];

  // Pressing A increments the counter by the current stepsize
  pressA(e) -> ([counter <- counter + stepsize]);

  // Pressing A three times in a row multiplies the stepsize by 3 unless B or C is pressed
  pressA(e) && X (pressA(e) && X pressA(e))
    -> [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)] W (pressB(e) || pressC(e));

  // Pressing B increments the counter by 2 and resets stepsize to 1
  pressB(e) -> ([counter <- counter + 2] && [stepsize <- 1]);

  // Pressing C increments the counter by 3 and resets stepsize to 1
  pressC(e) -> ([counter <- counter + 3] && [stepsize <- 1]);
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Mutual Exclusion**: This ensures that no two button presses can occur at the same time, which simplifies the handling of the state changes without race conditions.

2. **Initial Step Size**: Sets the initial `stepsize` to 1.

3. **Incrementing Counter**: The counter increments by the current `stepsize` when the A key is pressed, by 2 when the B key is pressed, and by 3 when the C key is pressed.

4. **Step Size Modification**: When the A key is pressed three times consecutively, the `stepsize` multiplies by 3. This modified step size continues until either B or C is pressed, which resets the `stepsize` to 1.

The specification handles the stepsize modification and reset logic in sequence, ensuring that the system responds correctly to the described user interactions.
