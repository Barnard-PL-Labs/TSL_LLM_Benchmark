Below is the TSL specification based on the natural language description provided for button operations altering a counter increment size:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure that no two counter operations can occur at the same time
  !(pressA(e) && pressB(e));
  !(pressA(e) && pressC(e));
  !(pressB(e) && pressC(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Handle the pressA functionality
  pressA(e) -> (
    ([stepsize <- stepsize] W (pressA(e) && X (pressA(e) && X pressA(e)))) U (pressB(e) || pressC(e)) 
    || [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)]
  );

  // Reset stepsize to 1 upon pressB or pressC
  (pressB(e) || pressC(e)) -> [stepsize <- 1];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions**:
    - Mutual exclusion is assumed between all button presses to ensure that no two operations can be performed simultaneously.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - When the 'A' key is pressed, it checks if the 'A' key is pressed two more times consecutively without any interruption from 'B' or 'C' keys. If this sequence is confirmed, the stepsize is multiplied by three. If any other key ('B' or 'C') is pressed during the sequence, it resets the stepsize to 1.
   - Directly resetting the stepsize to 1 when either 'B' or 'C' is pressed.
  
This specification follows the specified behavior of modifying a counter increment size based on button presses, ensuring that the stepsize changes correctly while preventing multiple button operations from occurring simultaneously.
