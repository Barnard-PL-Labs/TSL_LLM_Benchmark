Given the descriptions and requirements, we can design the JavaScript functions and predicates according to the scenario described. Since the explanation mentions "cells" that represent states and actions like pressing keys, this implementation can be envisioned as part of a larger system that possibly interacts with a user interface or an event-driven environment.

However, without additional specifics on how the environment passes these "cells" or state signals to the functions, I'll provide a general implementation approach, assuming the cells are accessible as variables or can be passed as arguments to the functions.

Here is the JavaScript implementation for the specified functions and predicates:

```javascript
// Functions
function multiplyByThree(stepsize) {
    return stepsize * 3;
}

// Predicates
function pressA(e) {
    // Assuming 'e' is an object with properties indicating which key is pressed
    return e.key === 'a';
}

function pressB(e) {
    // Assuming 'e' is an object with properties indicating which key is pressed
    return e.key === 'b';
}

function pressC(e) {
    // Assuming 'e' is an object with properties indicating which key is pressed
    return e.key === 'c';
}
```

### Usage Example
To use these functions and predicates, you might typically have an event handler in your system that listens for keypress events. Below is an example of how you might set up such handlers in a web environment, assuming `stepsize` and `e` are available when the event occurs.

```javascript
// Sample HTML for testing
document.body.innerHTML = '<div>Press A, B, or C keys</div>';

// Event listener for keypresses
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
    const stepsize = 5; // let's assume this is the current step size
    const e = { key: event.key.toLowerCase() }; // Normalize key to lowercase

    if (pressA(e)) {
        console.log('A was pressed.');
        console.log('Counter incremented by:', multiplyByThree(stepsize));
    } else if (pressB(e)) {
        console.log('B was pressed.');
        // Implement additional logic for B if needed
    } else if (pressC(e)) {
        console.log('C was pressed.');
        // Implement additional logic for C if needed
    }
});
```

### Considerations
1. **Environment-specific Functions**: The implementation assumes a general JavaScript environment. Adjustments might be needed depending on the specific system API or framework you are working with.

2. **State Management**: The above examples don't manage state beyond the scope of the event listener callback. In a real application, you might want to manage `stepsize`, `e`, and other states more persistently, possibly using a state management library or framework capabilities.

3. **Event Object Normalization**: The key normalization (`event.key.toLowerCase()`) is simple and assumes the keys are detected in a consistent format which might not always be the case, especially with different browsers or input methods. 

This implementation provides a basic structure to expand upon based on further specifics of your system's requirements and capabilities.
