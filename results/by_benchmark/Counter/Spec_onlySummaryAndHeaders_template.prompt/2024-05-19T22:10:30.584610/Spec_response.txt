Here is the TSL specification based on your description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // No two counter operations (button presses) can occur simultaneously
  !(pressA(e) && pressB(e));
  !(pressA(e) && pressC(e));
  !(pressB(e) && pressC(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Pressing the A key increments the counter by the stepsize, which starts at 1
  pressA(e) -> ([counter <- counter + stepsize]);

  // If A is pressed three times consecutively without B or C being pressed, multiply stepsize by 3
  pressA(e) && X(pressA(e)) && X(X(pressA(e))) && !X(pressB(e) || pressC(e)) && !X(X(pressB(e) || pressC(e)))
    -> [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)];

  // Pressing the B key increments the counter by 2 and resets stepsize to 1
  pressB(e) -> ([counter <- counter + 2] && [stepsize <- 1]);

  // Pressing the C key increments the counter by 3 and resets stepsize to 1
  pressC(e) -> ([counter <- counter + 3] && [stepsize <- 1]);
}
```

This TSL setup ensures that pressing the A key three times consecutively, without interruption from the B or C key, will increase the stepsize by a factor of three. Pressing either the B or C key resets the stepsize to 1 and increments the counter as specified. The mutual exclusion logic ensures that no two button presses happen simultaneously, adhering to the constraints of your scenario.
