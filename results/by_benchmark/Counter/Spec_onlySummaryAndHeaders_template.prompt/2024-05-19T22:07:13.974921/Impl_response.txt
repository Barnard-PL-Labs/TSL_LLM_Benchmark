To implement the requested functions and predicates based on the provided description and API details, here's how you could define them using JavaScript. Note that since we do not have a specific API wrapper provided, the implementation will have to assume generic JavaScript functions and an event-driven approach for detecting key presses.

### Functions

1. **multiplyByThree** - a simple function that takes an input and returns the result of the input multiplied by three.

```javascript
function multiplyByThree(stepsize) {
    return stepsize * 3;
}
```

### Predicates

These predicates will check if specific keys ('a', 'b', 'c') have been pressed. We'll use an event listener to detect keypress events. For simplicity, I'll assume that the variable `e` is an event object available in the scope where these functions are called, typically provided by an event listener.

```javascript
// Predicates to detect key presses
function pressA(e) {
    return e.key === 'a';
}

function pressB(e) {
    return e.key === 'b';
}

function pressC(e) {
    return e.key === 'c';
}
```

### Example Usage

Here is how you might set up the event listeners and use these functions within a web environment. This example assumes you are working within a browser environment where `document.addEventListener` is available.

```javascript
document.addEventListener('keypress', function(e) {
    // Assuming stepsize is stored and modified elsewhere in your application
    let stepsize = 1;  // This would normally be managed by your application state

    if (pressA(e)) {
        console.log('Key A pressed');
        // Example action: increment a counter by the stepsize
        counter += stepsize;  // Assume 'counter' is a variable tracking some count
        console.log('Counter updated to:', counter);
    } else if (pressB(e)) {
        console.log('Key B pressed');
        // Example action: multiply the stepsize by three
        stepsize = multiplyByThree(stepsize);
        console.log('Stepsize updated to:', stepsize);
    } else if (pressC(e)) {
        console.log('Key C pressed');
        // Additional action can be defined here
    }
});
```

This setup allows for a simple interaction model where pressing keys 'a', 'b', or 'c' triggers corresponding predicates and actions. Make sure you adapt the exact details such as variable and state management according to your specific application architecture and requirements.
