Here is the TSL specification derived from the natural language description given:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensures exclusive key press at any time
  !(pressA(e) && pressB(e));
  !(pressA(e) && pressC(e));
  !(pressB(e) && pressC(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // When A is pressed, increase counter by stepsize; after 3 consecutive presses, change stepsize, unless B or C is pressed which resets stepsize to 1
  pressA(e) -> ([counter <- counter + stepsize] && (X (pressA(e) -> (X (pressA(e) -> ([stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)] W (pressB(e) || pressC(e))))))));
  
  // When B is pressed, increase counter by 2 and reset stepsize to 1
  pressB(e) -> ([counter <- counter + 2] && [stepsize <- 1]);
  
  // When C is pressed, increase counter by 3 and reset stepsize to 1
  pressC(e) -> ([counter <- counter + 3] && [stepsize <- 1]);
}
```

Explanation of the code:

1. **Assumptions**: 
   - Ensure that no two keys are pressed at the same time using mutual exclusion with the `!(p1 && p2)` pattern for each pair of keys (A/B, A/C, B/C).

2. **Guarantees**:
   - **Pressing A**: Increase the counter by the stepsize. If A is pressed three times consecutively, the stepsize is multiplied by 3 using the function `multiplyByThree(stepsize)`, unless B or C is pressed in between, which would reset the stepsize to 1 immediately.
   - **Pressing B**: Increase the counter by 2 and reset the stepsize to 1.
   - **Pressing C**: Increase the counter by 3 and reset the stepsize to 1.

This specification covers the incremental logic based on button presses and resets the increment step size depending on specified conditions, handling exclusion efficiently by ensuring key actions are mutually exclusive.
