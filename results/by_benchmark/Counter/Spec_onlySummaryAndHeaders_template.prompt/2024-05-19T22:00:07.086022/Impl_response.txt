To implement the specified functions and predicates in JavaScript, we need to define how each function operates and ensure that the predicates return a boolean value depending on the state of the input, `e`. Since there is no provided wrapper or explicit API interaction details, the functions and predicates are explained assuming `e` represents some form of event object and the `stepsize` is a global variable or contextually available within the function.

Here is a basic implementation:

### JavaScript Code Implementation

```javascript
// Assuming stepsize is globally defined or managed in the context where these functions are used
let stepsize = 1; // Initialize stepsize as specified

// Function to multiply the stepsize by three
function multiplyByThree(stepsize) {
    return stepsize * 3;
}

// Predicate to check if 'a' key was pressed
function pressA(e) {
    return e.key === 'a';
}

// Predicate to check if 'b' key was pressed
function pressB(e) {
    return e.key === 'b';
}

// Predicate to check if 'c' key was pressed
function pressC(e) {
    return e.key === 'c';
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Global Variable `stepsize`**: Initialized globally. This allows it to be accessed and modified as needed without needing to pass it around functions. It starts at 1 each time the program starts as per the requirement.

2. **Function `multiplyByThree`**: This function takes a numerical value as an argument (assumed to be `stepsize` or similar) and returns it multiplied by three. It's a pure function, depending only on its input.

3. **Predicates `pressA`, `pressB`, `pressC`**:
   - These functions are implemented to check if the respective keys ('a', 'b', 'c') are pressed. 
   - They take an event object `e` as parameter, which should contain a key attribute typically available in keyboard event objects in JavaScript.
   - Returns `true` if the specified key is the one pressed, otherwise returns `false`.

### Usage Example:

You might use these functions in an event listener context like so:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
    if (pressA(event)) {
        console.log("Key 'A' was pressed");
        console.log("New step size after multiplication:", multiplyByThree(stepsize));
    } else if (pressB(event)) {
        console.log("Key 'B' was pressed");
    } else if (pressC(event)) {
        console.log("Key 'C' was pressed");
    }
});
```

This setup allows for interactive testing with key presses in a browser environment, showcasing how the functions and predicates operate based on user input.
