Below is the TSL specification based on the given natural language description and the available functions and predicates:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Mutual exclusion for button press events
  !(pressA(e) && pressB(e));
  !(pressA(e) && pressC(e));
  !(pressB(e) && pressC(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Reset stepsize to 1 if B or C key is pressed
  (pressB(e) || pressC(e)) -> [stepsize <- 1];

  // Setup for pressing A key
  pressA(e) -> (
    // The third consecutive A press increments stepsize by multiplying by three
    X (pressA(e) -> (
      X (pressA(e) -> [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)])
    ))
  );

  // Increment counter based on which key is pressed
  pressA(e) -> [counter <- counter + stepsize];
  pressB(e) -> [counter <- counter + 2];
  pressC(e) -> [counter <- counter + 3];
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Mutual Exclusion**: The assumptions ensure that no two button presses can happen at the same time (mutual exclusion).

2. **Button Press Actions**:
   - **A key**: If the A key is pressed three times consecutively, it changes the `stepsize` by multiplying it by three. The counter is then incremented by the current `stepsize`.
   - **B key**: Pressing the B key resets the `stepsize` to 1 and increments the counter by 2.
   - **C key**: Pressing the C key resets the `stepsize` to 1 and increments the counter by 3.

3. **Resetting Stepsize**: Whenever the B or C key is pressed, `stepsize` is reset to 1, ensuring that any multiplier effect from consecutive A presses is removed.

This specification is designed to reflect the counter behavior as influenced by the button presses and their sequence, ensuring that all conditions described are met.
