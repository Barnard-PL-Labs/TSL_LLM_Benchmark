To translate the given natural language description into a TSL (Temporal Stream Logic) specification, we need to ensure the logic captures the behavior of button presses and their effect on a counter increment size. This involves ensuring that pressing different keys affects the counter correctly and adheres to the logic of step size manipulation.

Here is the TSL code reflecting the description provided:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Exclusive relationship between button presses
  !(pressA(e) && pressB(e));
  !(pressA(e) && pressC(e));
  !(pressB(e) && pressC(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Initialize stepsize to 1 at the start
  [stepsize <- 1];

  // Handling button A press
  pressA(e) -> {
    // Increment the counter by the current stepsize
    [counter <- counter + stepsize];

    // If pressed three times consecutively, multiply stepsize by 3
    // Reset if either B or C is pressed
    (X (pressA(e)) && X (X pressA(e))) -> [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)] W (pressB(e) || pressC(e));
  };

  // Handling button B press
  pressB(e) -> {
    // Increment the counter by 2 and reset stepsize to 1
    [counter <- counter + 2];
    [stepsize <- 1];
  };

  // Handling button C press
  pressC(e) -> {
    // Increment the counter by 3 and reset stepsize to 1
    [counter <- counter + 3];
    [stepsize <- 1];
  };
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Assumptions**:
   - The system assumes that no two button operations (A, B, C) can occur simultaneously, ensuring mutual exclusivity in button presses.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - The stepsize is initialized to 1 at the start.
   - For button A:
     - Each press increments the counter by the current step size.
     - If A is pressed three consecutive times, stepsize is multiplied by 3, unless an intervening press of B or C resets the stepsize to 1.
   - For button B:
     - Pressing B increments the counter by 2 and resets the stepsize to 1 immediately.
   - For button C:
     - Pressing C increments the counter by 3 and resets the stepsize to 1 immediately.

This specification carefully adheres to the rules laid out in the natural language description regarding the button press impact on the counter and stepsize manipulation.
