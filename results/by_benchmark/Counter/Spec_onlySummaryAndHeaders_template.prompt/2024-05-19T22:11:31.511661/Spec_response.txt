To translate the given natural language description into a TSL specification, we need to first define the assumptions concerning the exclusivity of button presses and the rules that govern button functions. Then, we will detail the guarantees that dictate how the system should react based on these inputs.

Here is how you can structure the TSL specification based on this description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Mutual exclusion for button presses
  !(pressA(e) && pressB(e));
  !(pressA(e) && pressC(e));
  !(pressB(e) && pressC(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Initialization of stepsize to 1 at the start
  [stepsize <- 1];

  // Handling pressA
  pressA(e) -> (
    [counter <- counter + stepsize] W (pressB(e) || pressC(e))
  );

  // When A is pressed 3 times consecutively without B or C being pressed
  (X(pressA(e) && X(pressA(e) && X(pressA(e) && !(pressB(e) || pressC(e)))))) -> (
    [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)]
  );

  // Reset stepsize to 1 if B or C is pressed
  (pressB(e) || pressC(e)) -> [stepsize <- 1];

  // Handling pressB
  pressB(e) -> [counter <- counter + 2];

  // Handling pressC
  pressC(e) -> [counter <- counter + 3];
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Assumptions**: We ensure that no two buttons can be pressed simultaneously by defining mutual exclusions between all pairs of button presses.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - The `stepsize` is initialized to 1 at the start of the program.
   - Pressing the A button increments the counter by the current `stepsize`. The increment continues until either B or C is pressed, at which point the increment action waits (weak until).
   - If the A button is pressed three consecutive times without B or C interrupting, the `stepsize` is multiplied by three. This checks three successive states where A is pressed and neither B nor C are pressed.
   - If either B or C is pressed at any time, the `stepsize` is reset to 1.
   - Pressing B increments the counter by 2.
   - Pressing C increments the counter by 3.

This TSL specification describes the behavior of the system based on button presses and their effects on the `counter` and `stepsize` as specified in the description.
