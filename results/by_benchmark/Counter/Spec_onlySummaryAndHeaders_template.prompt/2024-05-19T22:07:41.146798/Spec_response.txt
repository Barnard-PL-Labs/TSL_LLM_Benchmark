To translate your requirements into a TSL specification, we need to encode the behavior of buttons A, B, and C with their respective effects on a counter and the conditions under which the step size changes. Here is the TSL specification based on your description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure mutual exclusion between pressing buttons A, B, and C
  !(pressA(e) && pressB(e));
  !(pressA(e) && pressC(e));
  !(pressB(e) && pressC(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Define initial step size
  [stepsize <- 1];

  // When button A is pressed, increment the counter by the stepsize
  pressA(e) -> ([counter <- counter + stepsize]);

  // When button B is pressed, increment the counter by 2 and reset stepsize to 1
  pressB(e) -> ([counter <- counter + 2] && [stepsize <- 1]);

  // When button C is pressed, increment the counter by 3 and reset stepsize to 1
  pressC(e) -> ([counter <- counter + 3] && [stepsize <- 1]);

  // After pressing A three times consecutively without B or C, multiply stepsize by 3
  // Using a count tracking the number of consecutive A presses
  pressA(e) -> (
    [aCount <- aCount + 1] 
    W (pressB(e) || pressC(e))
  );
  (aCount = 3) -> [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)];
}
```

This specification uses a cell `aCount` to track consecutive presses of button A and adjusts the `stepsize` when A is pressed three times consecutively without interruption by presses of B or C. When either button B or C is pressed, it not only increments the counter by the specified amounts (2 and 3, respectively) but also resets the `stepsize` to 1, as per the specification. The `aCount` is incremented with each press of A and watched until either B or C is pressed (using weak until `W`), at which point it would reset (though not explicitly shown in this pseudo-code, you would need to reset `aCount` upon pressing B or C or after updating `stepsize`). Additionally, the initial step size is set to 1 at the start of the program, as stated in the description.
