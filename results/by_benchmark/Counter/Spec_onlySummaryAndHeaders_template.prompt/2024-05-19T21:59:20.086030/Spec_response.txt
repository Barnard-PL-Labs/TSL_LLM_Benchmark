Here's a TSL specification reflecting the provided natural language description:

```
always assume {
  // Mutual exclusion for all button presses
  !(pressA(e) && pressB(e));
  !(pressA(e) && pressC(e));
  !(pressB(e) && pressC(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Pressing A increments the counter by stepsize
  pressA(e) -> [counter <- counter + stepsize];
  
  // Pressing B increments the counter by 2 and resets stepsize to 1
  pressB(e) -> ([counter <- counter + 2] && [stepsize <- 1]);
  
  // Pressing C increments the counter by 3 and resets stepsize to 1
  pressC(e) -> ([counter <- counter + 3] && [stepsize <- 1]);
  
  // Pressing A three times consecutively without pressing B or C in between multiplies stepsize by 3
  (G (pressA(e) && X(pressA(e) && X(pressA(e)))) && !(X(pressB(e) || pressC(e)) || X(X(pressB(e) || pressC(e)))) )
    -> [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)];
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Assumption Section**
   - Ensures that no two button presses can be registered simultaneously. This implements the mutual exclusion of button operations.

2. **Guarantee Section**
   - **Pressing A**: Increments the counter by the current value of `stepsize`.
   - **Pressing B**: Increments the counter by 2 and resets `stepsize` to 1.
   - **Pressing C**: Increments the counter by 3 and resets `stepsize` to 1.
   - **Triple A Press without B or C**: If the A key is pressed three times consecutively without either B or C being pressed in between, `stepsize` is multiplied by 3. This logic uses nested next (X) operators to check for three consecutive presses and checks that neither B nor C are pressed in the next two intervals after an A press.
