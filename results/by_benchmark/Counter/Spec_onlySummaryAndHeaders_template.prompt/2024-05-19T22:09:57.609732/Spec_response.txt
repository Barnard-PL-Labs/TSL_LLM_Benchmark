Here is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure mutual exclusion between pressing A, B, and C keys
  !(pressA(e) && pressB(e)) ;
  !(pressA(e) && pressC(e)) ;
  !(pressB(e) && pressC(e)) ;
}

always guarantee {
  // Pressing the A key increments the counter by the current step size
  pressA(e) -> [counter <- counter + stepsize];

  // Pressing the A key three times in a row without interruption by pressing B or C modifies the step size
  pressA(e) && X (pressA(e) && X pressA(e)) && !(X (pressB(e) || pressC(e)) || X X (pressB(e) || pressC(e)))
    -> X X X [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)];

  // Pressing the B key increments the counter by 2 and resets the step size to 1
  pressB(e) -> ([counter <- counter + 2] && [stepsize <- 1]);

  // Pressing the C key increments the counter by 3 and resets the step size to 1
  pressC(e) -> ([counter <- counter + 3] && [stepsize <- 1]);
}
```

Explanation:
- **Mutual Exclusion**: The `assume` section ensures that no two counter operations (pressing A, B, or C) are performed simultaneously.
- **Incrementing Counter**: The `guarantee` section contains logic for how the counter should be incremented based on which button is pressed.
- **Multiple Presses of A**: If the A button is pressed three times consecutively without the B or C buttons being pressed in between, the step size is multiplied by three. This logic involves checking the next (X) and the next-next (X X) states to ensure A is pressed consecutively three times.
- **Resetting Step Size**: Pressing either B or C resets the step size to 1 and increments the counter by a fixed amount (2 for B, 3 for C), regardless of the current step size.
