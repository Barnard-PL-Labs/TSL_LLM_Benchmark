To implement the functions and predicates described using JavaScript, you can assume that the API provides some way for `stepsize` and `e` to be read and potentially updated. I'll provide JavaScript implementations for each of the functions and predicates.

First, you'll want to define the functions `multiplyByThree` that will multiply the input by 3. This function is straightforward:

```javascript
function multiplyByThree(stepsize) {
    return stepsize * 3;
}
```

Next, you'll need to implement the predicates which determine if certain keys (`a`, `b`, or `c`) have been pressed, based on the state of `e`. Assuming that `e` might contain information about which key was pressed, these predicates can be implemented by checking the value of `e`:

```javascript
function pressA(e) {
    return e === 'a';
}

function pressB(e) {
    return e === 'b';
}

function pressC(e) {
    return e === 'c';
}
```

These functions and predicates should be used according to how your system environment provides the values of `stepsize` and `e`. If `stepsize` and `e` are part of a state object or are parameters to a function within a larger system, you'd reference or pass them accordingly.

In an event-driven or interactive application, `e` might be set by key press events. Here is a simple example of how you might configure such an event handler in a browser environment:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
    const keyName = event.key;
    let stepsize = 1; // example value for stepsize

    if (pressA(keyName)) {
        console.log('Key A pressed.');
        console.log('New stepsize if multiplied by three:', multiplyByThree(stepsize));
    } else if (pressB(keyName)) {
        console.log('Key B pressed.');
    } else if (pressC(keyName)) {
        console.log('Key C pressed.');
    }
});
```

This example uses browser APIs to handle key events and logs messages depending on which key was pressed. Adjustments would be necessary based on the specifics of your system's API and how `stepsize` and `e` are handled in your environment.
