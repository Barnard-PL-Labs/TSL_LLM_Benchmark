To implement the specified functions and predicates using JavaScript, we'll follow these steps:

1. Define the functions `multiplyByThree` that takes a step size and multiplies it by 3.
2. Define the predicates `pressA`, `pressB`, and `pressC` that each take an event object `e` and return a boolean indicating whether specific keys ('a', 'b', 'c' respectively) were pressed.

Here's how you can implement these functions and predicates in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Functions
function multiplyByThree(stepsize) {
    return stepsize * 3;
}

// Predicates
function pressA(e) {
    return e.key === 'a';
}

function pressB(e) {
    return e.key === 'b';
}

function pressC(e) {
    return e.key === 'c';
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Functions**:
   - `multiplyByThree(stepsize)`: This function simply takes a `stepsize` and returns it multiplied by 3, based on the problem statement.

2. **Predicates**:
   - `pressA(e)`, `pressB(e)`, `pressC(e)`: These functions check if the `key` property of the event object `e` matches 'a', 'b', and 'c', respectively. They return `true` if there's a match, indicating that the specified key was pressed, and `false` otherwise.

### Usage Example:

Assuming you have some HTML and JavaScript where keyboard events can be captured, you can use these functions as follows:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
    <p>Press a, b, or c on your keyboard:</p>
    <script>
        // Include the functions here

        document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
            if (pressA(event)) {
                console.log("A was pressed");
            } else if (pressB(event)) {
                console.log("B was pressed");
            } else if (pressC(event)) {
                console.log("C was pressed");
            }
        });
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

This HTML page will listen for keydown events and use the predicates `pressA`, `pressB`, and `pressC` to determine which key was pressed, then log a message to the console accordingly.
