Here is the TSL specification based on your description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure no two button presses occur at the same time
  !(pressA(e) && pressB(e));
  !(pressA(e) && pressC(e));
  !(pressB(e) && pressC(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Pressing the A key consecutively three times multiplies the stepsize by 3, unless B or C is pressed which resets stepsize to 1
  pressA(e) -> (
    X (pressA(e) -> (
      X (pressA(e) -> [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)] W (pressB(e) || pressC(e)))
    )) W (pressB(e) || pressC(e))
  );
  
  // Pressing B or C resets the stepsize to 1
  (pressB(e) || pressC(e)) -> [stepsize <- 1];
}
```

Explanation:

1. **Assumptions**: This section makes sure that no two buttons are pressed at the same time which aligns with the requirement that no two counter operations can overlap.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - **Pressing A Key**: When the A key is first pressed, the system looks ahead to check if it will be pressed again immediately in the next two steps (X operator for next state). If A is indeed pressed three times consecutively, the `stepsize` is updated by multiplying it by three using the `multiplyByThree()` function. This sequence of presses is monitored until either the B or C key is pressed (indicated by the weak until `W`), which would break the sequence and prevent the stepsize from tripling.
   - **Pressing B or C Key**: Any press of B or C immediately resets the `stepsize` to 1. This is a direct command that does not depend on further conditions beyond the button press itself.
