To implement the functions and predicates described, I'll provide you with JavaScript code snippets that assume you have a way to handle event detection (like key presses) and manage state changes for the cells. Here, I'll outline a basic structure using JavaScript closures to encapsulate the state for `stepsize` and use basic functions to handle the logic for predicates and other manipulations.

### Setup and Functions

Firstly, we'll initialize the `stepsize` and define the function `multiplyByThree`:

```javascript
// Initializing cell for stepsize
let stepsize = 1; // Starts at 1 each program start

// Function to multiply stepsize by three
function multiplyByThree(stepsizeValue) {
    return stepsizeValue * 3;
}
```

### Predicates

For the predicates, we need to detect key presses. This can be achieved using event listeners if this is in a browser environment, or using other methods in different JavaScript environments (e.g., Node.js with readline or similar libraries). Here's how you might do it in a browser:

```javascript
// Cells to capture events
let e = {
    a: false,
    b: false,
    c: false
};

// Event listener for keydown events to update the state of 'e'
document.addEventListener('keydown', (event) => {
    if (event.key === 'a') {
        e.a = true;
    } else if (event.key === 'b') {
        e.b = true;
    } else if (event.key === 'c') {
        e.c = true;
    }
});

// Event listener for keyup events to reset the state of 'e'
document.addEventListener('keyup', (event) => {
    if (event.key === 'a') {
        e.a = false;
    } else if (event.key === 'b') {
        e.b = false;
    } else if (event.key === 'c') {
        e.c = false;
    }
});

// Predicates to check if a particular key is pressed
function pressA(e) {
    return e.a;
}

function pressB(e) {
    return e.b;
}

function pressC(e) {
    return e.c;
}
```

### Usage Example

Hereâ€™s how you might use these functions and predicates in your code:

```javascript
// Example usage
if (pressA(e)) {
    console.log("The 'A' key was pressed.");
    // Increment the counter by `stepsize`
    counter += stepsize;
}

if (pressB(e)) {
    console.log("The 'B' key was pressed.");
    // Change stepsize by multiplying it by three
    stepsize = multiplyByThree(stepsize);
}

if (pressC(e)) {
    console.log("The 'C' key was pressed.");
    // Reset stepsize to 1 or any other required operation
    stepsize = 1;
}
```

This setup assumes that the browser environment is used for simplicity. Adaptations may be necessary depending on the specific requirements of your environment (e.g., server-side JavaScript, different libraries for event handling, or a specific development framework).
