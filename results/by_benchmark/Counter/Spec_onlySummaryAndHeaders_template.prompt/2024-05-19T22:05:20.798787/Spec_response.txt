Here is the TSL specification based on the provided requirements and the given functions and predicates:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure that no two counter operations are simultaneous
  !(pressA(e) && pressB(e));
  !(pressA(e) && pressC(e));
  !(pressB(e) && pressC(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // If the A key is pressed three times in a row, the step size is multiplied by 3,
  // unless B or C is pressed, which resets the step size to 1
  pressA(e) -> (
    [e <- e + stepsize] && (
      X(pressA(e) -> (
        [e <- e + stepsize] && (
          X(pressA(e) -> ([stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)] && [e <- e + stepsize]))
          W (pressB(e) || pressC(e))
        ))
      ))
    )
  );

  // If B is pressed, increment counter by 2 and reset stepsize to 1
  pressB(e) -> ([e <- e + 2] && [stepsize <- 1]);

  // If C is pressed, increment counter by 3 and reset stepsize to 1
  pressC(e) -> ([e <- e + 3] && [stepsize <- 1]);

  // Ensure that stepsize starts at 1 at program start
  initially ([stepsize <- 1]);
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions Section:**
   - Prevents simultaneous pressing of any two keys among A, B, and C.

2. **Guarantees Section:**
   - Defines the behavior when the A key is pressed:
     - Increments the counter by the current step size.
     - If A is pressed a second time immediately after, it increments again.
     - If A is pressed a third time consecutively, it multiplies the step size by 3 before the next increment.
     - If either B or C is pressed before the third consecutive A press, the step size resets to 1.
   - Sets the action for pressing B to increment the counter by 2 and resets the step size to 1.
   - Sets the action for pressing C to increment the counter by 3 and resets the step size to 1.
   - Initializes the step size to 1 at program start to ensure a consistent starting condition.
