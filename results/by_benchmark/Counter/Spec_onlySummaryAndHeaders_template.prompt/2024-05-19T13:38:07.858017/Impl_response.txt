To implement the specified functions and predicates using JavaScript, you first need to define your "functions" and "predicates" based on the requirements provided. Since we don't have a direct API to manipulate or get the data from "cells", let's assume that `stepsize` and `e` are accessible and mutable within our code environment.

Here's how you can implement these in JavaScript:

### Functions

For the `multiplyByThree` function, you take a `stepsize` parameter, multiply it by 3, and return the result.

```javascript
function multiplyByThree(stepsize) {
    return stepsize * 3;
}
```

### Predicates

For the predicates `pressA`, `pressB`, and `pressC`, these will depend on the `e` cell, which supposedly captures the state of the user's key presses. Assuming `e` could look something like an object where each key's press state is a boolean, you can define the predicates as follows:

```javascript
function pressA(e) {
    return e.a === true;  // Returns true if 'a' key is pressed, assuming 'e' has a boolean property 'a'
}

function pressB(e) {
    return e.b === true;  // Returns true if 'b' key is pressed, assuming 'e' has a boolean property 'b'
}

function pressC(e) {
    return e.c === true;  // Returns true if 'c' key is pressed, assuming 'e' has a boolean property 'c'
}
```

### Usage Example

To see these functions and predicates in action, you can set up an example environment and simulate user inputs:

```javascript
// Example environment setup
let stepsize = 2;
let e = {
    a: false,
    b: false,
    c: false
};

// User presses 'a'
e.a = true;

// Check which keys are pressed
console.log("Is 'a' pressed?", pressA(e));  // Output: Is 'a' pressed? true
console.log("Is 'b' pressed?", pressB(e));  // Output: Is 'b' pressed? false
console.log("Is 'c' pressed?", pressC(e));  // Output: Is 'c' pressed? false

// Use the multiplyByThree function
console.log("Stepsize multiplied by three:", multiplyByThree(stepsize));  // Output: Stepsize multiplied by three: 6

// Reset 'a' key press
e.a = false;
```

This simple setup and functions will allow you to handle the basic functionality as described. If the environment `e` and `stepsize` are supposed to be more complex or come from an external source, you would need to adjust the access methods appropriately.
