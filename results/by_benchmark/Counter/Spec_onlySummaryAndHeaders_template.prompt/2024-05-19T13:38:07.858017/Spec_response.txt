Here is the TSL specification that reflects the given natural language description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Mutually exclusive key presses
  !(pressA(e) && pressB(e));
  !(pressA(e) && pressC(e));
  !(pressB(e) && pressC(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Pressing the A key three times in a row changes the stepsize by multiplying it by 3
  (pressA(e) && X(pressA(e) && X(pressA(e))))
    -> [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)] W (pressB(e) || pressC(e));

  // Pressing the B or C key resets the stepsize to 1
  (pressB(e) || pressC(e))
    -> [stepsize <- 1];

  // Ensure no two operations can be performed simultaneously (handled in assumptions)
}
```

Explanation:
- **Assumptions**: The assumption section declares that no two of the key presses (`pressA(e)`, `pressB(e)`, `pressC(e)`) can occur at the same time. This is enforced by logical negations ensuring that pressing one key excludes the others.
  
- **Guarantees**: 
  - The first guarantee captures the condition where pressing the A key three times consecutively changes the `stepsize` by multiplying it by three. This continues until either key B or C is pressed which resets the behavior.
  - The second guarantee sets the `stepsize` to 1 whenever the B or C key is pressed. This effectively resets the increment value of the counter when either of these keys is engaged.

These rules collectively ensure that the counter is incremented correctly based on the specified key presses and conditions.
