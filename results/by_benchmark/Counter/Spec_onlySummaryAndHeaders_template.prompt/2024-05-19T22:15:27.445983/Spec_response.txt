Based on the natural language description provided, the TSL specification can be written as follows:

```TSL
always assume {
  // Ensure that no two button operations occur at the same time
  !(pressA(e) && pressB(e));
  !(pressA(e) && pressC(e));
  !(pressB(e) && pressC(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Pressing the A key increments the counter by the current 'stepsize'
  pressA(e) -> [counter <- counter + stepsize];

  // Pressing the B key increments the counter by 2 and resets 'stepsize' to 1
  pressB(e) -> ([counter <- counter + 2] && [stepsize <- 1]);

  // Pressing the C key increments the counter by 3 and resets 'stepsize' to 1
  pressC(e) -> ([counter <- counter + 3] && [stepsize <- 1]);

  // If A is pressed 3 times consecutively without B or C being pressed in between, multiply 'stepsize' by 3
  (pressA(e) -> X (pressA(e) -> X (pressA(e) -> [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)] W (pressB(e) || pressC(e)))));
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Assumptions**:
    - Mutual exclusion is assumed for button presses, ensuring that no two buttons can be pressed simultaneously. This is essential to prevent conflicting actions on the counter.
    
- **Guarantees**:
    - **A Key Press**: When the A key is pressed, the counter is incremented by the current `stepsize`. The `stepsize` starts at 1 and can be modified under specific conditions.
    - **B Key Press**: When the B key is pressed, the counter increases by 2 and `stepsize` is reset to 1. This ensures that any modification to `stepsize` by consecutive A key presses is reset.
    - **C Key Press**: Similarly, pressing the C key results in the counter increasing by 3 and `stepsize` resetting to 1.
    - **Consecutive A Key Presses**: If the A key is pressed three consecutive times without intervening presses of B or C, `stepsize` is multiplied by 3. This condition uses the weak until (`W`) operator to monitor for interruptions by B or C key presses.

This TSL specification aligns with the operational rules described in the natural language description, structuring the logic to handle button presses and their effects on a counter system.
