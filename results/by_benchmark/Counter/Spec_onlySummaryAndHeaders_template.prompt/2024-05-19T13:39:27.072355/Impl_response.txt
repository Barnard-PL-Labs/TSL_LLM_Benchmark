To implement the required functions and predicates in JavaScript, you can define them as regular JavaScript functions. Below are the implementations for each of the specified functions and predicates using simple logic and mock behavior, given that the environment specifics such as how `e` (the event or signal state) is structured are not explicitly defined.

### Functions Implementation

For the function `multiplyByThree`, we assume that `stepsize` is a numeric value and the function returns the multiplication of this value by 3.

```javascript
function multiplyByThree(stepsize) {
    return stepsize * 3;
}
```

### Predicates Implementation

For the predicates `pressA`, `pressB`, and `pressC`, we assume that `e` is an object containing the state of keys. In a real-world scenario, this could be an event object typically obtained from keyboard events in a browser or other environments. The predicates check if the specific keys ('a', 'b', 'c') are pressed.

```javascript
// Assuming `e` is an object with key states, where true means the key is pressed
function pressA(e) {
    return e && e.a === true;
}

function pressB(e) {
    return e && e.b === true;
}

function pressC(e) {
    return e && e.c === true;
}
```

### Example Usage

Here's how you might use these functions and predicates, assuming `e` is an event object:

```javascript
// Mock event objects for demonstration
let eventState = {
    a: false,
    b: true,
    c: false
};

console.log("Multiply by Three: ", multiplyByThree(10));  // Output: 30
console.log("Press A: ", pressA(eventState));  // Output: false
console.log("Press B: ", pressB(eventState));  // Output: true
console.log("Press C: ", pressC(eventState));  // Output: false
```

### Notes

- In a real application, `e` would likely come from event listeners attached to user inputs (like keyboard or button presses).
- The actual structure of `e` and how it indicates a key press can vary depending on your application environment (e.g., web, desktop application). In web environments, this typically involves listening to `keydown` or `keyup` events on the `document` or specific elements.
- The above code assumes synchronous checks. If dealing with asynchronous events (like actual user interaction), you would need to embed these checks within event handlers.

This should provide a starting point based on your requirements and the assumed structure of the `e` object.
