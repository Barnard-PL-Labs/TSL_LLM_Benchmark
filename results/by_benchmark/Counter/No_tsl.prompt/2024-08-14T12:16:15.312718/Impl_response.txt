Here's a JavaScript implementation of the function `updateState` based on the given natural language description. This function demonstrates the behavior of incrementing a counter based on the input of pressing 'A', 'B', or 'C' keys, along with the special rules associated with the 'A' key.

```javascript
function updateState({ currentState, e, stepsize }) {
    // Destructure current state for easy access
    const { count, aPressCounter } = currentState;

    // Initialize new state variables
    let newCount = count;
    let newStepsize = stepsize;
    let newAPressCounter = aPressCounter;

    // Check which key is pressed and update the state accordingly
    if (pressA(e)) {
        if (newAPressCounter === 3) {
            // When 'A' is pressed for the third time consecutively
            newStepsize = multiplyByThree(stepsize);
            newAPressCounter = 0; // reset the counter after increasing stepsize
        }
        newCount += newStepsize;
        newAPressCounter++; // increment the counter for consecutive 'A' presses
    } else if (pressB(e) || pressC(e)) {
        // If either 'B' or 'C' is pressed, reset stepsize to 1
        newStepsize = 1;
        newAPressCounter = 0; // reset the A press counter
        newCount += pressB(e) ? 2 : 3; // increment count by 2 if 'B' is pressed, by 3 if 'C' is pressed
    }

    // Return the new state
    return {
        currentState: {
            count: newCount,
            aPressCounter: newAPressCounter
        },
        stepsize: newStepsize
    };
}
```

### Explanation

1. **State Variables**: The function takes `currentState` which includes `count` (the current value of the counter) and `aPressCounter` (tracks consecutive presses of 'A' key). `stepsize` determines the increment on pressing 'A'.

2. **Button Press Logic**:
   - **Press A**: The counter `newCount` is incremented by `newStepsize`. If it's the third consecutive press of 'A', `stepsize` is multiplied by three. The counter for consecutive 'A' presses (`aPressCounter`) is managed to trigger the multiplication condition.
   - **Press B or C**: Resets the `stepsize` to 1 and `aPressCounter` to 0. The counter `newCount` is incremented by 2 for 'B' and by 3 for 'C'.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns the updated `currentState` including the new `count` and `aPressCounter`, along with the possibly modified `stepsize`.

This setup adheres to the rules defined in the description and ensures that the behavior of the counter changes correctly based on the sequence of button presses.
