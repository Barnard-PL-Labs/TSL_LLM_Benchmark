Based on the given natural language description, predicates, functions, and cells, the JavaScript function `updateState` can be implemented as follows:

```javascript
function updateState({ currentState, e }) {
    // Initialize variables from current state
    let { count, stepsize, consecutiveA } = currentState;

    if (pressA(e)) {
        // If A is pressed, check if it has been pressed 3 times consecutively
        if (consecutiveA === 2) { // Already pressed three times, this is the fourth
            stepsize = multiplyByThree(stepsize);
            consecutiveA = 0; // Reset the consecutive A count after increasing stepsize
        } else {
            consecutiveA += 1; // Increment the consecutive A count
        }
        count += stepsize; // Increment counter by stepsize
    } else if (pressB(e)) {
        count += 2; // Increment counter by 2
        stepsize = 1; // Reset stepsize to 1
        consecutiveA = 0; // Reset consecutive A count
    } else if (pressC(e)) {
        count += 3; // Increment counter by 3
        stepsize = 1; // Reset stepsize to 1
        consecutiveA = 0; // Reset consecutive A count
    }

    // Return the updated state
    return {
        count: count,
        stepsize: stepsize,
        consecutiveA: consecutiveA,
    };
}

// Example usage
let currentState = {
    count: 0,
    stepsize: 1,
    consecutiveA: 0,
};
let e = {
    // Simulate button presses
};

// Update state based on e (environment inputs)
let newState = updateState({ currentState, e });

// newState would now hold the updated count, stepsize, and consecutiveA
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: Extract `count`, `stepsize`, and `consecutiveA` from `currentState`.
2. **Button Press Logic**:
    - **Press A**: Increment the consecutive counter for A. If A has been pressed three times previously (i.e., `consecutiveA` was 2), multiply `stepsize` by three (using `multiplyByThree` function). Otherwise, just increment the counter by the current `stepsize`.
    - **Press B or C**: Both of these keys reset the `stepsize` to 1 and reset the `consecutiveA` counter to 0. They also increment the `count` by 2 or 3, respectively.
3. **State Update**: After processing the event `e`, return a new state object with the updated `count`, `stepsize`, and `consecutiveA`.

### Notes:
- **Mutual Exclusion** for button presses (A, B, C) is assumed based on the description.
- **Initial Values** for `stepsize` and `consecutiveA` are crucial and should be appropriately initialized in the `currentState` before the first call to `updateState`.
- **Environment (`e`)** needs to provide information about which button is pressed in each call to simulate this setup properly.
