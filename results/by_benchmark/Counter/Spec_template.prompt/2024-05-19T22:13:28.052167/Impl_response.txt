To implement the functions and predicates as described using JavaScript, we can build upon a simple assumption that the environment provides a way to track key presses and that the "cells" `stepsize` and `e` are managed as either objects or variables within the global scope. Here's a basic implementation based on these guidelines:

### Step 1: Setting Up the Environment
To simulate this environment, we'll need to set up event listeners for keypresses and manage the `stepsize` cell:

```javascript
// Initialize cells
let stepsize = 1; // stepsize starts at 1 each program start
let e = { key: '' }; // e will store the last key pressed

// Event listener for keypresses to update the cell `e`
document.addEventListener('keydown', (event) => {
    e.key = event.key; // store the last key pressed in `e`
});
```

### Step 2: Implementing Functions
We'll create the function `multiplyByThree` that takes `stepsize` and multiplies it by 3.

```javascript
function multiplyByThree(stepsize) {
    return stepsize * 3;
}
```

### Step 3: Implementing Predicates
These predicates check if specific keys have been pressed according to the `e` cell.

```javascript
function pressA(e) {
    return e.key === 'a'; // returns true if 'a' was the last key pressed
}

function pressB(e) {
    return e.key === 'b'; // returns true if 'b' was the last key pressed
}

function pressC(e) {
    return e.key === 'c'; // returns true if 'c' was the last key pressed
}
```

### Example Usage
Here is how you might use these functions and predicates during the runtime of your application:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('keydown', (event) => {
    e.key = event.key; // Update the global cell `e` with the latest key press

    // Check if the 'a' key was pressed and perform actions based on that
    if (pressA(e)) {
        console.log(`Key 'A' was pressed. Increment by stepsize: ${stepsize}`);
        // In real scenarios, you might increment some counter here by `stepsize`
    }

    // Example of using the function
    if (event.key === 'b') { // If 'b' key is pressed, modify stepsize
        stepsize = multiplyByThree(stepsize);
        console.log(`Key 'B' was pressed. New stepsize: ${stepsize}`);
    }
});
```

This setup and these functions provide a basic framework for handling and responding to keypress events within an assumed environment, as detailed in your requirements. Adjustments might be needed based on the actual API capabilities and the broader application context.
