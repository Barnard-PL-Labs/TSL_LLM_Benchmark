Here is the TSL (Temporal Stream-based Specification Language) specification based on the provided natural language description:

```TSL
always assume {
  // Ensure no two button operations can occur at the same time
  !(pressA(e) && pressB(e));
  !(pressA(e) && pressC(e));
  !(pressB(e) && pressC(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Increment the counter by the current step size when A is pressed
  pressA(e) -> [count <- count + stepsize];
  
  // Increment the counter by 2 when B is pressed
  pressB(e) -> [count <- count + 2];
  
  // Increment the counter by 3 when C is pressed
  pressC(e) -> [count <- count + 3];

  // If A is pressed three times in a row, multiply the stepsize by three
  pressA(e) && X(pressA(e)) && X(X(pressA(e))) && X(X(X(pressA(e)))) -> [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)];
  
  // Reset stepsize to 1 when B or C is pressed
  (pressB(e) || pressC(e)) -> [stepsize <- 1];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions**:
   - The `!(pressA(e) && pressB(e));` and similar statements ensure mutual exclusion, meaning that no two button presses can occur at the same time. This is important for maintaining clear and exclusive counter operations for each button press.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - `pressA(e) -> [count <- count + stepsize];` ensures that each time the A button is pressed, the counter is incremented by whatever the current `stepsize` is.
   - `pressB(e) -> [count <- count + 2];` and `pressC(e) -> [count <- count + 3];` handle the counter increments for B and C button presses respectively.
   - The line `pressA(e) && X(pressA(e)) && X(X(pressA(e))) && X(X(X(pressA(e)))) -> [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)];` deals with the scenario where pressing the A key three times in a row leads to tripling the `stepsize`. The `X` operator is used to check the state of the next time instance.
   - `(pressB(e) || pressC(e)) -> [stepsize <- 1];` resets the `stepsize` to 1 whenever B or C is pressed. This ensures that any increase in `stepsize` due to consecutive A presses is negated, maintaining the described behavior.
