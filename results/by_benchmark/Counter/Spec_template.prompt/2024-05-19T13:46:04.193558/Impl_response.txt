To implement the described functions and predicates in JavaScript, you'll need to define each function and predicate accordingly. Since the details about how you get the values of cells `stepsize` and `e` are not provided, I will assume these are given or can be accessed directly.

Here's the JavaScript code that defines the required functions and predicates:

```javascript
// Functions
function multiplyByThree(stepsize) {
  return stepsize * 3;
}

// Predicates
function pressA(e) {
  // Assuming `e` indicates the event or signal when 'a' is pressed
  return e.key === 'a' || e === 'a';
}

function pressB(e) {
  // Assuming `e` indicates the event or signal when 'b' is pressed
  return e.key === 'b' || e === 'b';
}

function pressC(e) {
  // Assuming `e` indicates the event or signal when 'c' is pressed
  return e.key === 'c' || e === 'c';
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **multiplyByThree(stepsize)**: This function takes a number (`stepsize`) and multiplies it by 3. It's a straightforward mathematical operation.

2. **pressA(e)**, **pressB(e)**, and **pressC(e)**: These predicates determine if the 'a', 'b', or 'c' keys were pressed, respectively. The implementation assumes that the input `e` can be an event object with a property `key` that holds the value of the pressed key (this is common in many JavaScript event handling scenarios). The function checks whether this key matches 'a', 'b', or 'c'. Alternatively, for simplicity, if `e` directly holds the value of the key, it checks against that.

### Usage:
To use these functions and predicates, you could have event listeners if applicable, or just call them directly with the appropriate inputs. Here's an example using these in an event listener context:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
  if (pressA(event)) {
    console.log('Key A was pressed.');
  }
  if (pressB(event)) {
    console.log('Key B was pressed.');
  }
  if (pressC(event)) {
    console.log('Key C was pressed.');
  }
});

// Assuming 'stepsize' is available and set to 2
var incrementedValue = multiplyByThree(2);
console.log('Step size after multiplication:', incrementedValue);
```

This setup assumes you are working in a browser environment where `keydown` events can be listened to on the `document` object. The code captures key presses and responds accordingly, while also demonstrating how to use the `multiplyByThree` function. Adjustments may be necessary based on the specific environment or framework you are working within.
