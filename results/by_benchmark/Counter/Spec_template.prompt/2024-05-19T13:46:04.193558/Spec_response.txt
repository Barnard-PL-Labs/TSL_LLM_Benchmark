Here's the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description and the functions, predicates, and structure you've given:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Mutual exclusion between button presses to ensure no two operations happen simultaneously
  !(pressA(e) && pressB(e));
  !(pressA(e) && pressC(e));
  !(pressB(e) && pressC(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Incrementing the counter by 1, 2 or 3 depending on which button is pressed
  pressA(e) -> [count <- count + 1];
  pressB(e) -> [count <- count + 2];
  pressC(e) -> [count <- count + 3];

  // Handling the special case for pressing the 'A' button three times in a row
  (pressA(e) && X(pressA(e)) && X(X(pressA(e))) && X(X(X(pressA(e))))) -> [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)];

  // Resetting the stepsize to 1 when B or C is pressed
  (pressB(e) || pressC(e)) -> [stepsize <- 1];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions**:
    - We use mutual exclusion to ensure that no two button operations can occur at the same time. This is a common constraint to enforce that the operations triggered by button presses do not interfere with each other.

2. **Guarantees**:
    - The counter increments by 1, 2, or 3 when pressing the A, B, or C keys respectively.
    - If the A key is pressed three times in a row, the fourth press triggers a change in the stepsize by tripling it using the `multiplyByThree(stepsize)` function.
    - Pressing the B or C key resets the stepsize to 1, ensuring the special increment condition (triplication) is controlled and reset appropriately.

This specification directly reflects the operations described and handles the interaction between button presses and their effects on both the counter and stepsize variables.
