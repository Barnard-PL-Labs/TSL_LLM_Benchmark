```TSL
always assume {
  // Ensure that only one button can be pressed at a time
  !(pressA(e) && pressB(e));
  !(pressA(e) && pressC(e));
  !(pressB(e) && pressC(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // If button A is pressed, increment the counter by the current stepsize
  pressA(e) -> [count <- count + stepsize];

  // If button B is pressed, increment the counter by 2 and reset stepsize to 1
  pressB(e) -> ([count <- count + 2] && [stepsize <- 1]);

  // If button C is pressed, increment the counter by 3 and reset stepsize to 1
  pressC(e) -> ([count <- count + 3] && [stepsize <- 1]);

  // When pressA is pressed three times consecutively without interruption by pressB or pressC, multiply stepsize by 3
  pressA(e) && X(pressA(e)) && X(X(pressA(e))) && X(X(X(pressA(e && !pressB(e) && !pressC(e)))))
    -> [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)];
}
```

This TSL code captures the requirements specified. It assumes that only one of the buttons can be pressed at any given time, thus preventing simultaneous presses. The guarantees section outlines how each button press affects the `count` and `stepsize`, including the special behavior of `pressA` when pressed three times consecutively without interruption.
