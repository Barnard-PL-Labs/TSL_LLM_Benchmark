Below is a JavaScript implementation that utilizes a fictional API setup based on your description. Since the specific API functions and cells aren't explicitly described, we'll need to assume some behavior about how state and events are managed in JavaScript.

Here's a hypothetical setup for implementing the specified functions and predicates:

```javascript
// Assuming cell 'stepsize' and signal 'e' are available globally or within a suitable scope.

// Cell to represent stepsize, starting at 1
let stepsize = 1;

// Object 'e' to simulate event signaling (might typically be populated by real event handlers in a complete system)
let e = {
  key: null
};

// Function to simulate key press events (in a real environment, this would be handled by actual event listeners)
function simulateKeyPress(key) {
  e.key = key;
}

// Functions
function multiplyByThree(stepsize) {
  return stepsize * 3;
}

// Predicates
function pressA(e) {
  return e.key === 'a';
}

function pressB(e) {
  return e.key === 'b';
}

function pressC(e) {
  return e.key === 'c';
}

// Example Usage:
console.log("Initial stepsize:", stepsize);
let tripledStepsize = multiplyByThree(stepsize);
console.log("Tripled stepsize:", tripledStepsize);

simulateKeyPress('a');
console.log("Did press A:", pressA(e));  // Expected: true
console.log("Did press B:", pressB(e));  // Expected: false

simulateKeyPress('b');
console.log("Did press B:", pressB(e));  // Expected: true
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Stepsize Initialization:** We start by setting `stepsize` to 1.
2. **Event Simulation (`simulateKeyPress`):** This function sets the `key` property on the `e` object. This is a basic simulation, modeling how key press events might modify an object in an actual event-driven environment.
3. **Function `multiplyByThree`:** This function takes a number and returns it multiplied by three.
4. **Predicates:** `pressA`, `pressB`, and `pressC` check the current value of `e.key` to determine if the respective keys 'a', 'b', or 'c' were pressed.

This example assumes simplistic event handling and global access to `e` and `stepsize`. In a real-world application, you'd likely use more sophisticated state management and event handling (such as using React's state, or similar frameworks/libraries).
