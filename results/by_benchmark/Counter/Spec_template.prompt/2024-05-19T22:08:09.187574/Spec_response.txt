Here is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description and functions:

```tsl
always assume {
    // mutual exclusion of button presses
    !(pressA(e) && pressB(e));
    !(pressA(e) && pressC(e));
    !(pressB(e) && pressC(e));
}

always guarantee {
    // handle pressA action
    pressA(e) -> ([count <- count + stepsize]);

    // If A is pressed three times consecutively without B or C interrupting, multiply stepsize by 3
    G (pressA(e) && X (pressA(e) && X (pressA(e) && X (pressA(e)))))
      -> ([stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)] W (pressB(e) || pressC(e)));
      
    // handle pressB action
    pressB(e) -> ([count <- count + 2] && [stepsize <- 1]);

    // handle pressC action
    pressC(e) -> ([count <- count + 3] && [stepsize <- 1]);
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions** ensure that no two counter (button) operations are performed at the same time by mutually excluding simultaneous button presses.

2. **Guarantees** handle the increment actions for each button:
   - For `pressA`, the counter is incremented by the current `stepsize`.
   - For `pressB`, the counter is incremented by 2, and `stepsize` is reset to 1.
   - For `pressC`, the counter is incremented by 3, and `stepsize` is reset to 1.
   - Additionally, there is a specific rule for `pressA` where if it is pressed four times in a row without `pressB` or `pressC` occurring in between, the `stepsize` is multiplied by three. This change in `stepsize` continues until either `pressB` or `pressC` is pressed, which resets `stepsize` to 1.
