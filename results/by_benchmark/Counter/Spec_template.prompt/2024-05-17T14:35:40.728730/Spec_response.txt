To translate the given natural language description into a TSL specification, we'll specify both the assumptions (environmental conditions) and guarantees (system reactions) based on the requirements. The system involves handling button presses and calculating counter increments based on these presses, with specific rules for modifying a stepsize multiplier.

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure that no two button presses can happen at the same time
  !(pressA(e) && pressB(e));
  !(pressA(e) && pressC(e));
  !(pressB(e) && pressC(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // When pressA is pressed, increment the counter by stepsize
  pressA(e) -> [count <- count + stepsize];
  
  // When pressB is pressed, increment the counter by 2 and reset stepsize to 1
  pressB(e) -> ([count <- count + 2] && [stepsize <- 1]);
  
  // When pressC is pressed, increment the counter by 3 and reset stepsize to 1
  pressC(e) -> ([count <- count + 3] && [stepsize <- 1]);
  
  // When pressA is pressed three times in a row, on the fourth press, multiply stepsize by 3
  // Assuming a mechanism to track consecutive presses of A (e.g., aPressCount)
  pressA(e) && aPressCount == 3 -> [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)];
  pressA(e) -> [aPressCount <- aPressCount + 1];
  (pressB(e) || pressC(e)) -> [aPressCount <- 0]; // Reset on B or C press
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Assumptions**: We assume that no two button presses can happen simultaneously. This is enforced by mutual exclusion conditions for button presses.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - **Incrementing the Counter**: For each button press, the counter is incremented by a specific amount. PressA increments by `stepsize`, which can change based on the sequence of presses.
   - **Handling Button B and C**: Pressing either B or C resets the `stepsize` to 1 and increments the counter by 2 or 3 respectively.
   - **Special Handling of Repeated PressA**: If the A button is pressed three times consecutively, the next pressA will cause `stepsize` to be multiplied by three. This implies there needs to be a mechanism to track consecutive presses, suggested here as `aPressCount`. This count is incremented with each A press and reset if either B or C is pressed.

This TSL specification enforces that the stepsize adjustment and counter increments perform as described, within the constraints of the provided functionality and predicates. Note that the actual implementation of checking consecutive A presses (e.g., maintaining `aPressCount`) would need appropriate initialization and handling in the full system context.
