Here is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description and functions:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Mutual exclusion of button presses: No two buttons can be pressed at the same time
  !(pressA(e) && pressB(e)) && !(pressA(e) && pressC(e)) && !(pressB(e) && pressC(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // When button A is pressed, increase the counter by the current stepsize
  pressA(e) -> [count <- count + stepsize];

  // When button B is pressed, increase the counter by 2 and reset the stepsize to 1
  pressB(e) -> ([count <- count + 2] && [stepsize <- 1]);

  // When button C is pressed, increase the counter by 3 and reset the stepsize to 1
  pressC(e) -> ([count <- count + 3] && [stepsize <- 1]);

  // Special rule for pressing A three times in a row: subsequent press multiplies stepsize by 3
  // This assumes an external mechanism to track consecutive A presses, reset on B or C
  (pressA(e) && X(pressA(e) && X(pressA(e) && X(pressA(e)))))
    -> [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)];

  // Reset stepsize to 1 when either B or C is pressed
  (pressB(e) || pressC(e)) -> [stepsize <- 1];
}
```

This specification makes several assumptions:
1. The button press events `pressA`, `pressB`, and `pressC` are mutually exclusive, ensuring that no two button operations can happen simultaneously.
2. The counter is incremented according to the button pressed and the conditions associated with it.
3. The `stepsize` is affected by consecutive presses of button A, unless interrupted by pressing either button B or C.
4. Resetting the `stepsize` to 1 when either button B or C is pressed is explicitly stated in the guarantees for both buttons. 

This implementation also assumes that there's a mechanism to track consecutive presses of button A, which should ideally be reset when either button B or C is pressed. This detail might need additional internal state handling or clarification on how consecutive A presses are tracked and reset.
