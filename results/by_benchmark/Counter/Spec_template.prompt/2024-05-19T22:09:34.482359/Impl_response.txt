Here is the JavaScript implementation for the given functions and predicates using the provided API descriptions. Since there's no explicit wrapper API, the system environment hints seem to imply a generic approach. We'll use JavaScript functions to simulate the environment behavior and the predicates.

First, let's create a simple simulation environment for handling the keypress events and maintaining the state of `stepsize` and `e`.

### JavaScript Implementation

```javascript
// Simulate cells
let stepsize = 1;  // Starting value of stepsize each program start
let e = { a: false, b: false, c: false };  // Initial states for keypresses

// Function to multiply stepsize by three
function multiplyByThree(stepsize) {
    return stepsize * 3;
}

// Predicates to check if a specific key has been pressed
function pressA(e) {
    return e.a;
}

function pressB(e) {
    return e.b;
}

function pressC(e) {
    return e.c;
}

// To simulate the environment where key states can be changed
function setKeyState(key, state) {
    if (e.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
        e[key] = state;
    }
}

// Example usage
setKeyState('a', true);  // Simulate pressing 'a'
if (pressA(e)) {
    console.log(`'a' key was pressed. Current stepsize: ${stepsize}, New stepsize: ${multiplyByThree(stepsize)}`);
}

setKeyState('b', true);  // Simulate pressing 'b'
if (pressB(e)) {
    console.log(`'b' key was pressed.`);
}

setKeyState('c', true);  // Simulate pressing 'c'
if (pressC(e)) {
    console.log(`'c' key was pressed.`);
}

// Resetting key presses
setKeyState('a', false);
setKeyState('b', false);
setKeyState('c', false);
```

### Explanation:

1. **Cells**:
   - `stepsize`: Represents how much pressing the "a" key increments a counter. It starts at 1.
   - `e`: Represents the state of key presses (a, b, c).

2. **Functions**:
   - `multiplyByThree(stepsize)`: Multiplies the `stepsize` by 3.

3. **Predicates**:
   - `pressA(e)`, `pressB(e)`, `pressC(e)`: Check if the respective keys are pressed.

4. **setKeyState function**: This function is a utility to simulate different states of key presses in the system environment.

This setup mimics an environment where keys can trigger certain functions or predicates based on their states. This is a simple emulation, and in a real-world application, event listeners or similar constructs would be used to handle dynamic changes in the system state based on user interactions.
