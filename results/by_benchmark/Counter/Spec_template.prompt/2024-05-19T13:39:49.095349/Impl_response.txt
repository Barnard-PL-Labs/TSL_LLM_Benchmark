To implement the described functions and predicates in JavaScript, we can start by defining the functions `multiplyByThree(stepsize)`, and predicates `pressA(e)`, `pressB(e)`, and `pressC(e)` based on the description you provided. Since the `e` cell represents the state of the signal, we can assume it contains information about key presses, and `stepsize` is a numeric value.

Here is the JavaScript implementation:

```javascript
// Function to multiply stepsize by three
function multiplyByThree(stepsize) {
    return stepsize * 3;
}

// Predicate to check if the 'a' key was pressed
function pressA(e) {
    // Assuming 'e' is an object with properties indicating which key is pressed
    return e.a === true;  // 'a' key press state
}

// Predicate to check if the 'b' key was pressed
function pressB(e) {
    return e.b === true;  // 'b' key press state
}

// Predicate to check if the 'c' key was pressed
function pressC(e) {
    return e.c === true;  // 'c' key press state
}

// Example usage
let e = {
    a: true,
    b: false,
    c: false
};

let stepsize = 10;

console.log("Multiply by three:", multiplyByThree(stepsize));  // Output: 30
console.log("Did press A:", pressA(e));  // Output: true
console.log("Did press B:", pressB(e));  // Output: false
console.log("Did press C:", pressC(e));  // Output: false
```

### Explanation:
1. **multiplyByThree(stepsize)**: This function multiplies the given `stepsize` by 3. It takes a number and returns a number.
2. **pressA(e)**, **pressB(e)**, and **pressC(e)**: These predicates check if the corresponding keys 'a', 'b', or 'c' are pressed. They take an object `e` which represents the state of different key presses. Each function returns a boolean indicating whether the particular key is pressed.

This code assumes that the `e` object will be provided with boolean properties `a`, `b`, and `c`, each representing whether the respective key is pressed (`true` for pressed, `false` for not pressed). Adjustments may be needed based on the actual API details and how `e` is structured.
