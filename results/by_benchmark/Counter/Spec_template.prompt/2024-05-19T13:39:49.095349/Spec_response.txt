Here is the TSL specification based on your natural language description:

```TSL
always assume {
  // Ensure mutual exclusion for button presses
  !(pressA(e) && pressB(e));
  !(pressA(e) && pressC(e));
  !(pressB(e) && pressC(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Increment counter by 1 when A is pressed
  pressA(e) -> ([count <- count + 1]);

  // Increment counter by 2 when B is pressed
  pressB(e) -> ([count <- count + 2]);

  // Increment counter by 3 when C is pressed
  pressC(e) -> ([count <- count + 3]);

  // When A is pressed three times in a row, the fourth press multiplies stepsize by 3
  (pressA(e) && X(pressA(e)) && X(X(pressA(e))) && X(X(X(pressA(e)))))
    -> [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)];

  // Reset stepsize to 1 when B or C is pressed
  (pressB(e) || pressC(e)) -> [stepsize <- 1];
}
```

Explanation:
- **Assumptions**: The assumptions ensure that no two presses of A, B, and C can occur simultaneously, maintaining mutual exclusion.
- **Guarantees**:
  1. When A is pressed, the counter increments by 1 using the previous count value.
  2. When B is pressed, the counter increments by 2.
  3. When C is pressed, the counter increments by 3.
  4. A special rule applies when A is pressed four times in sequence without interference from B or C: on the fourth press, the stepsize is increased by multiplying it by three. This is achieved by chaining the pressA predicate with temporal operators (`X` for next state).
  5. The stepsize is reset to 1 if either B or C is pressed, ensuring that the customization by pressing A multiple times is removed upon pressing B or C.
