To implement the given methods in JavaScript, you will need to handle cell states and interactions with the keyboard inputs. Below, I will provide a setup for a JavaScript application that includes the implementation of the functions and predicates as described. Note that in a real-world scenario, these would typically be part of a larger application, possibly involving event listeners for a GUI or a game engine.

### JavaScript Implementation

Here's how you might set up and implement these requirements:

```javascript
// Cell definitions
let stepsize = 1;  // This represents the stepsize cell, initialized to 1
let e = {};  // This represents the 'e' cell, which will store key press states

// Function to multiply the stepsize by three
function multiplyByThree(stepsize) {
    return stepsize * 3;
}

// Predicates to check if specific keys are pressed
function pressA(e) {
    return e['A'] || false;  // Returns true if 'A' is true in the e object, otherwise false
}

function pressB(e) {
    return e['B'] || false;  // Returns true if 'B' is true in the e object, otherwise false
}

function pressC(e) {
    return e['C'] || false;  // Returns true if 'C' is true in the e object, otherwise false
}

// Example usage and setup to simulate key presses
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
    const keyName = event.key.toUpperCase();  // Normalize the key name to uppercase
    if (keyName === 'A' || keyName === 'B' || keyName === 'C') {
        e[keyName] = true;  // Mark the key as pressed in the 'e' object
    }
});

document.addEventListener('keyup', function(event) {
    const keyName = event.key.toUpperCase();  // Normalize the key name to uppercase
    if (keyName === 'A' || keyName === 'B' || keyName === 'C') {
        e[keyName] = false;  // Mark the key as not pressed in the 'e' object
    }
});

// Logic to handle stepsize modification based on key press
setInterval(() => {
    if (pressA(e)) {
        console.log("Key A is pressed. Incrementing counter by stepsize:", stepsize);
        // Here you might increment some counter by stepsize
    }
    if (pressB(e)) {
        console.log("Key B is pressed. Multiplying stepsize by 3.");
        stepsize = multiplyByThree(stepsize);
    }
    if (pressC(e)) {
        console.log("Key C is pressed. Resetting stepsize to 1.");
        stepsize = 1;
    }
}, 1000);  // Check every 1000 milliseconds (1 second)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Cell Definitions**: Variables `stepsize` and `e` are used to track the state of the step size and the key press states respectively.
2. **Functions and Predicates**: Functions `multiplyByThree`, `pressA`, `pressB`, and `pressC` implement the required logic.
3. **Event Listeners**: `keydown` and `keyup` event listeners update the state of `e` based on user input.
4. **Interval Check**: A repeating interval checks the state of `e` to determine actions based on the predicates, such as modifying `stepsize` or handling other logic.

This script should be included in an HTML file or integrated into a larger JavaScript application to function. It assumes a web environment where `document` is available for attaching event listeners.
