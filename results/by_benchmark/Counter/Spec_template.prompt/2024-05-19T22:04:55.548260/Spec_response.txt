Here is the TSL specification based on the description provided:

```TSL
always assume {
  // No two buttons can be pressed at the same time
  !(pressA(e) && pressB(e));
  !(pressA(e) && pressC(e));
  !(pressB(e) && pressC(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // When pressA is pressed, increment the counter by stepsize
  pressA(e) -> [count <- count + stepsize];
  
  // When pressA is pressed three times consecutively without pressing B or C,
  // multiply stepsize by three
  pressA(e) && X (pressA(e) && X (pressA(e) && X (!pressB(e) && !pressC(e))))
    -> X X X [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)];
  
  // When pressB is pressed, increment the counter by 2 and reset stepsize to 1
  pressB(e) -> ([count <- count + 2] && [stepsize <- 1]);
  
  // When pressC is pressed, increment the counter by 3 and reset stepsize to 1
  pressC(e) -> ([count <- count + 3] && [stepsize <- 1]);
}
```

Explanation:

- **Assumptions:** Mutual exclusion is ensured between the button presses. Only one button can be pressed at any one time, which is critical to prevent simultaneous counter operations.

- **Guarantees:**
  1. If the A button is pressed, the `count` is incremented by `stepsize`.
  2. If the A button is pressed three times consecutively without any interruption by pressing B or C, then `stepsize` is multiplied by three after the third press.
  3. Pressing B increments the `count` by 2 and resets the `stepsize` to 1.
  4. Pressing C increments the `count` by 3 and also resets the `stepsize` to 1.

This specification captures the functionality described in the natural language specification, including button-specific actions and the influence of button press sequences on the `stepsize`.
