To implement the given functions and predicates using JavaScript, you will create a set of functions that interact with the API's cell constructs "stepsize" and "e". Below is a basic implementation for the outlined requirements:

### JavaScript Implementation

```javascript
// Assuming the environment provides a way to access and manipulate cells `stepsize` and `e`

// Functions:
function multiplyByThree(stepsize) {
    return stepsize * 3;
}

// Predicates:
function pressA(e) {
    // Assume `e` contains information about keypresses, and 'a' indicates the 'a' key is pressed
    return e === 'a';
}

function pressB(e) {
    // Assume `e` contains information about keypresses, and 'b' indicates the 'b' key is pressed
    return e === 'b';
}

function pressC(e) {
    // Assume `e` contains information about keypresses, and 'c' indicates the 'c' key is pressed
    return e === 'c';
}

// Example usage:
// Let's assume there is a way the environment updates these values based on actual events
let currentStepsize = 5;  // example stepsize value
let currentE = 'a';       // example keypress event

console.log("New stepsize when multiplied by three:", multiplyByThree(currentStepsize));
console.log("Is 'a' pressed:", pressA(currentE));
console.log("Is 'b' pressed:", pressB(currentE));
console.log("Is 'c' pressed:", pressC(currentE));
```

### Notes:

1. **Integrating with the System API**: This example assumes the cells `stepsize` and `e` can be accessed directly in some way. If these cells are part of an external system or library, you may need additional code to integrate properly. This could involve event listeners or direct API calls depending on the system's architecture.

2. **Data Handling**: The predicates `pressA`, `pressB`, and `pressC` assume that the cell `e` directly contains the string of the key pressed. If `e` is structured differently (e.g., an object or more complex data type), you will need to adjust the predicates to correctly interpret `e`.

3. **Environment and Testing**: The functionality of the implemented methods can be tested using unit tests or within an interactive environment that simulates key presses and updates the cell values accordingly.

This JavaScript code establishes the basic logic needed to work with the given API's cells and provides a starting point for more complex interactions depending on additional requirements or system details.
