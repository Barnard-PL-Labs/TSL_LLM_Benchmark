To implement the requested functions and predicates using JavaScript, we'll assume that the `stepsize` and `e` are represented as variables or properties of an object accessible in the environment. Here, I'll provide JavaScript functions for `multiplyByThree` and predicates `pressA`, `pressB`, and `pressC`. These implementations are based on the assumption that the system provides the necessary information in the variable `e` for detecting key presses, and that `stepsize` is a numeric value that can be manipulated.

### Functions

```javascript
/**
 * Multiplies the given stepsize by 3.
 * @param {number} stepsize - The current stepsize.
 * @returns {number} - The stepsize multiplied by 3.
 */
function multiplyByThree(stepsize) {
    return stepsize * 3;
}
```

### Predicates
For the predicates, I'll assume that `e` contains properties that indicate whether the 'a', 'b', or 'c' keys are pressed. If `e` is structured differently, you might need to adjust the access methods accordingly. For example, if `e` is an object like `{ key: 'a' }`, the predicates would check `e.key === 'a'` and so on.

```javascript
/**
 * Checks if the 'a' key was pressed.
 * @param {object} e - The event object containing the key state.
 * @returns {boolean} - True if 'a' was pressed, false otherwise.
 */
function pressA(e) {
    return e.key === 'a';
}

/**
 * Checks if the 'b' key was pressed.
 * @param {object} e - The event object containing the key state.
 * @returns {boolean} - True if 'b' was pressed, false otherwise.
 */
function pressB(e) {
    return e.key === 'b';
}

/**
 * Checks if the 'c' key was pressed.
 * @param {object} e - The event object containing the key state.
 * @returns {boolean} - True if 'c' was pressed, false otherwise.
 */
function pressC(e) {
    return e.key === 'c';
}
```

### Usage Example
To use these functions and predicates, you would typically call them with the appropriate parameters depending on how your system tracks key presses and maintains the `stepsize` value.

```javascript
// Example usage assuming the environment sets these values
let stepsize = 1;
let e = { key: 'a' };

// Function usage
let increasedStepsize = multiplyByThree(stepsize);
console.log('Increased Step Size:', increasedStepsize);

// Predicate usage
if (pressA(e)) {
    console.log('A key was pressed.');
}

if (pressB(e)) {
    console.log('B key was pressed.');
}

if (pressC(e)) {
    console.log('C key was pressed.');
}
```

This example assumes that `e` is an object representing an event with a `key` property that holds the value of the last key pressed. Modify it to fit the actual structure of your event object as necessary.
