Here's the TSL specification based on your description:

```tsl
always assume {
    // Mutual exclusion for button presses to ensure no two counter operations are performed at the same time
    !(pressA(e) && pressB(e));
    !(pressA(e) && pressC(e));
    !(pressB(e) && pressC(e));
}

always guarantee {
    // Increment the counter by 1 when A is pressed
    pressA(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

    // Increment the counter by 2 when B is pressed
    pressB(e) -> [count <- count + 2];

    // Increment the counter by 3 when C is pressed
    pressC(e) -> [count <- count + 3];

    // Handle the special condition for pressing A three times in a row
    pressA(e) && X(pressA(e)) && X(X(pressA(e))) && X(X(X(pressA(e)))) ->
        [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)];

    // Reset the stepsize to 1 if either B or C is pressed
    (pressB(e) || pressC(e)) -> [stepsize <- 1];
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Assume Block**:
  - Ensures that no two buttons can be pressed simultaneously, which models the constraint that no two counter operations can be performed at the same time.

- **Guarantee Block**:
  - Defines the actions taken when each button is pressed:
    - **pressA(e):** Increments the counter by the current `stepsize` value.
    - **pressB(e):** Increments the counter by 2.
    - **pressC(e):** Increments the counter by 3.
  - Handles a special case where if A is pressed three consecutive times, the fourth consecutive press of A results in the `stepsize` being multiplied by three.
  - Resets the `stepsize` to 1 whenever B or C is pressed. This resets the increment value for A after it has been modified.
