Based on the natural language description provided, the TSL specification should ensure that the system behaves correctly according to the rules described for pressing the A, B, and C keys. Below is the corresponding TSL code structured into the `always assume` and `always guarantee` blocks:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure that no two counter operations can be performed at the same time
  !(pressA(e) && pressB(e));
  !(pressA(e) && pressC(e));
  !(pressB(e) && pressC(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Rule for pressing A button
  pressA(e) -> ([counter <- counter + stepsize]);
  
  // Rule for pressing B button
  pressB(e) -> ([counter <- counter + 2]);
  
  // Rule for pressing C button
  pressC(e) -> ([counter <- counter + 3]);

  // Increase stepsize by 3 times if A is pressed three times in a row
  // using a predicate to check if A was pressed three times consecutively
  (pressA(e) && X (pressA(e)) && X X (pressA(e)) && X X X (pressA(e))) -> [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)];
  
  // Resetting the stepsize to 1 when B or C is pressed
  (pressB(e) || pressC(e)) -> [stepsize <- 1];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions**:
   - Mutual exclusion is ensured for button presses to prevent simultaneous operations, as specified.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - When the A button is pressed, the counter is incremented by the current `stepsize`.
   - When the B or C button is pressed, the counter is incremented by a fixed amount (2 and 3 respectively).
   - A sequence of four consecutive presses of the A button triggers an increase in the `stepsize` by a function `multiplyByThree`.
   - Any press of B or C resets the `stepsize` to 1.

This specification adheres to the rules described in the natural language description, ensuring the counter's behavior and stepsize adjustments are correctly managed based on the button pressed.
