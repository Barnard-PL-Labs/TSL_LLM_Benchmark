To implement the required methods in JavaScript using the provided system API details, follow the structure below. Since there's no direct wrapper API mentioned, I'll provide basic JavaScript functions and predicates based on the assumption that the `e` cell brings in some event object, and `stepsize` is accessible as a variable.

### Functions
1. **multiplyByThree(stepsize)**
   - This function takes a `stepsize` input and multiplies it by 3.

```javascript
function multiplyByThree(stepsize) {
    return stepsize * 3;
}
```

### Predicates
1. **pressA(e)**
   - This predicate checks if the 'a' key was pressed. Assuming `e` is an event object that has key information.

```javascript
function pressA(e) {
    return e.key === 'a';
}
```

2. **pressB(e)**
   - This predicate checks if the 'b' key was pressed.

```javascript
function pressB(e) {
    return e.key === 'b';
}
```

3. **pressC(e)**
   - This predicate checks if the 'c' key was pressed.

```javascript
function pressC(e) {
    return e.key === 'c';
}
```

### Example of using these functions and predicates

You might call these functions and predicates in a context where `e` is an event triggered by pressing a key. An example setup could be a simple event listener in a browser environment:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
    if (pressA(event)) {
        console.log('A was pressed');
        // Assuming stepsize is a global or previously defined variable
        const newStepSize = multiplyByThree(stepsize);
        console.log('New step size after multiplying by three:', newStepSize);
    } else if (pressB(event)) {
        console.log('B was pressed');
    } else if (pressC(event)) {
        console.log('C was pressed');
    }
});
```

This setup uses `keydown` events to check which key was pressed and respond accordingly. It assumes that `stepsize` is defined elsewhere in your application's scope. Remember to adapt the environment handling (`e`, the event object, and `stepsize`) based on how they're actually implemented in your application's environment.
