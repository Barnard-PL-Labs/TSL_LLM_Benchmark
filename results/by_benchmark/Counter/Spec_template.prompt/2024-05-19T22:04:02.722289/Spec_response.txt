Here's the TSL specification based on your description for the button press scenario involving incrementing a counter:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure mutual exclusion between button press actions
  !(pressA(e) && pressB(e));
  !(pressA(e) && pressC(e));
  !(pressB(e) && pressC(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Action when the A button is pressed
  pressA(e) -> ([count <- count + stepsize] && X(pressA(e) -> X(pressA(e) -> X(pressA(e) -> [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)]))));
  
  // Action when the B button is pressed
  pressB(e) -> ([count <- count + 2] && [stepsize <- 1]);
  
  // Action when the C button is pressed
  pressC(e) -> ([count <- count + 3] && [stepsize <- 1]);
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Assumptions**:
    - Mutual exclusion is enforced to ensure that no two button presses can occur at the same time. This prevents any overlapping or conflicting counter increments.

2. **Guarantees**:
    - `pressA(e)`: When the A key is pressed, the counter is incremented by the current `stepsize`. If A is pressed three times consecutively, on the fourth press, `stepsize` is multiplied by three. This is achieved by nesting `X` (next) operators to check for three consecutive A presses, then applying the `multiplyByThree(stepsize)` function.
    - `pressB(e)`: When the B key is pressed, the counter is incremented by 2, and `stepsize` is reset to 1.
    - `pressC(e)`: When the C key is pressed, the counter is incremented by 3, and `stepsize` is reset to 1.

This specification fulfills the requirements stated in the natural language description, ensuring the proper function and interaction of button presses and their effects on the counter and stepsize.
