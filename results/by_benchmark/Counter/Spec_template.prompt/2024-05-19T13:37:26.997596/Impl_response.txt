Given that you need to implement certain methods in JavaScript to interact with a system environment based on provided specifications, here's how you can structure your functions and predicates using JavaScript. This solution assumes that you have a way to fetch or observe the state of 'stepsize' and 'e' and that pressing keys changes the state represented by the 'e' cell.

### Functions
The `multiplyByThree` function will take the `stepsize` cell's value and multiply it by three:

```javascript
function multiplyByThree(stepsize) {
    return stepsize * 3;
}
```

### Predicates
The predicates `pressA`, `pressB`, and `pressC` will check if the 'e' cell indicates that the 'a', 'b', or 'c' key respectively has been pressed. This assumes that `e` can somehow be checked for these key presses. I will demonstrate a plausible way to implement it assuming `e` holds the last key pressed:

```javascript
function pressA(e) {
    return e === 'a';
}

function pressB(e) {
    return e === 'b';
}

function pressC(e) {
    return e === 'c';
}
```

### Example Usage
To demonstrate these functions and predicates, let's assume `stepsize` and `e` are provided dynamically, possibly by some event listeners or other parts of your system:

```javascript
// Example values - in a real scenario, these would be dynamically determined by the system state
let stepsize = 2;
let e = ''; 

// Key press simulation
document.addEventListener('keydown', (event) => {
    e = event.key;  // Assuming 'e' captures the last key pressed
    console.log(`Key pressed: ${e}`);

    if (pressA(e)) {
        console.log("A was pressed.");
    } else if (pressB(e)) {
        console.log("B was pressed.");
    } else if (pressC(e)) {
        console.log("C was pressed.");
    }
});

// Usage of multiplyByThree
let newStepSize = multiplyByThree(stepsize);
console.log(`New Step Size after multiplying by three: ${newStepSize}`);
```

### Notes
- The above code assumes that you can modify `e` directly. In practice, you might have an API or some system method to get the current state of `e`.
- The `addEventListener` for `keydown` is a simple way to simulate the environment where `e` changes value based on user input. In a real application, you might have more sophisticated event handling and state management.
- This implementation is made purely based on assumptions since the actual system API details are not provided. Adjust accordingly based on how the system API allows you to interact with `stepsize` and `e`.
