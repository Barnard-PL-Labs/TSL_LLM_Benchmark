Here is a TSL specification based on the provided description:

```TSL
always assume {
  // Ensure that no two counter operations can be performed at the same time
  !(pressA(e) && pressB(e));
  !(pressA(e) && pressC(e));
  !(pressB(e) && pressC(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // When the A button is pressed, increment the counter by stepsize
  pressA(e) -> [count <- count + stepsize];

  // When the B button is pressed, increment the counter by 2
  pressB(e) -> ([count <- count + 2] && [stepsize <- 1]);

  // When the C button is pressed, increment the counter by 3
  pressC(e) -> ([count <- count + 3] && [stepsize <- 1]);

  // If the A button is pressed three times in a row, multiply the stepsize by 3
  pressA(e) && X(pressA(e) && X(pressA(e) && X(pressA(e))))
    -> [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)];

  // Reset stepsize to 1 if either B or C is pressed
  (pressB(e) || pressC(e)) -> [stepsize <- 1];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions**:
   - Mutual exclusivity for button presses is enforced, ensuring that no two button operations (pressA, pressB, pressC) can occur simultaneously.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - `pressA(e)`: Increments the counter by `stepsize`.
   - `pressB(e)`: Increments the counter by 2 and resets `stepsize` to 1.
   - `pressC(e)`: Increments the counter by 3 and also resets `stepsize` to 1.
   - `pressA(e) && X(pressA(e) && X(pressA(e) && X(pressA(e))))`: If the A button is pressed four times consecutively, the stepsize is multiplied by three.
   - `(pressB(e) || pressC(e))`: Any pressing of B or C resets the stepsize to 1.
