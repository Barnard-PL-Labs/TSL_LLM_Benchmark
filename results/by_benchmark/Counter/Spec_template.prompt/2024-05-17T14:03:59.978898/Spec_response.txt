Here is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description and the constraints for the buttons and the counter operations:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure that no two button presses can occur at the same time
  !(pressA(e) && pressB(e));
  !(pressA(e) && pressC(e));
  !(pressB(e) && pressC(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Increment the counter by 1 when the A button is pressed
  pressA(e) -> [count <- count + stepsize];

  // Increment the counter by 2 when the B button is pressed
  pressB(e) -> ([count <- count + 2] && [stepsize <- 1]);

  // Increment the counter by 3 when the C button is pressed
  pressC(e) -> ([count <- count + 3] && [stepsize <- 1]);

  // If A is pressed three times consecutively, multiply stepsize by 3
  G (((pressA(e) && X (pressA(e)) && X (X (pressA(e)))) && !(pressB(e) || pressC(e)))
    -> X (X (X ([stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)]))));

  // Reset stepsize to 1 if B or C is pressed
  (pressB(e) || pressC(e)) -> [stepsize <- 1];
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Assumptions**:
   - Ensures mutual exclusivity between the button presses, meaning no two buttons can be pressed simultaneously.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - When `pressA(e)` is detected, the `count` is incremented by the current `stepsize`.
   - When `pressB(e)` is detected, the `count` is incremented by 2, and `stepsize` is reset to 1.
   - When `pressC(e)` is detected, the `count` is incremented by 3, and `stepsize` is reset to 1.
   - If the A button is pressed three consecutive times without pressing B or C in between, the `stepsize` is multiplied by three after the third press. This uses the `G` operator to ensure the sequence occurs globally wherever it starts.
   - The `stepsize` resets to 1 whenever either B or C is pressed to ensure it does not carry over an increased multiplication factor erroneously after such events.
