Here's the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description and assumptions:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure that no two button presses can happen at the same time
  !(pressA(e) && pressB(e));
  !(pressA(e) && pressC(e));
  !(pressB(e) && pressC(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Increment the counter by 1, 2, or 3 depending on the button press
  pressA(e) -> [count <- count + stepsize];
  pressB(e) -> [count <- count + 2];
  pressC(e) -> [count <- count + 3];

  // Set the step size back to 1 if B or C is pressed
  (pressB(e) || pressC(e)) -> [stepsize <- 1];

  // If A is pressed three times in a row, multiply stepsize by 3 on the fourth press
  G((F(pressA(e) && X(pressA(e) && X(pressA(e) && X(pressA(e))))))) -> [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)];
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Assumptions**:
    - The `always assume` block prevents simultaneous button presses, ensuring that no two of the buttons `A`, `B`, or `C` can be pressed at the same time.

2. **Guarantees**:
    - The `always guarantee` block describes how the system responds to button presses:
      - **pressA(e)**: Increments the counter by the current `stepsize`.
      - **pressB(e) and pressC(e)**: Increment the counter by 2 and 3 respectively.
      - Both **pressB(e) and pressC(e)** also reset the `stepsize` to 1.
      - If **pressA** is pressed three times in a row, on the fourth consecutive press, `stepsize` is multiplied by three.

This TSL specification translates the input description into a formal notation, ensuring clarity and precision in expected behavior for each scenario described.
