To implement the required functions and predicates as described, we can define JavaScript functions and utilize the properties of the API's `stepsize` and `e` cells. Below, you'll find the JavaScript functions for `multiplyByThree` and predicates `pressA`, `pressB`, and `pressC`. 

Given that your description doesn't provide explicit detail on how the cells `stepsize` and `e` are structured, the following example assumes that `stepsize` can be used directly as a numerical value and that `e` contains information about which key is pressed. The exact handling may need adjustments based on the actual API details that you are using.

### JavaScript Implementation

#### Functions

```javascript
// Function to multiply the value of 'stepsize' by three
function multiplyByThree(stepsize) {
    return stepsize * 3;
}
```

#### Predicates

Since the actual method for checking if a key is pressed is not specified in the API you provided, we assume `e` is an object representing the state of the system/environment where each key's state can be accessed (true for pressed, false otherwise).

```javascript
// Predicate to check if the 'a' key is pressed
function pressA(e) {
    return e.a === true;
}

// Predicate to check if the 'b' key is pressed
function pressB(e) {
    return e.b === true;
}

// Predicate to check if the 'c' key is pressed
function pressC(e) {
    return e.c === true;
}
```

### Usage Example

Hereâ€™s how you might use these functions and predicates:

```javascript
// Example usage of the functions and predicates
let stepsize = 2;  // Example stepsize
let e = {a: true, b: false, c: false};  // Example environment state

console.log("stepsize multiplied by three:", multiplyByThree(stepsize));
console.log("Is 'a' pressed?", pressA(e));
console.log("Is 'b' pressed?", pressB(e));
console.log("Is 'c' pressed?", pressC(e));
```

### Note

- The functions and predicates are based on assumptions about the data structure of `e` and how `stepsize` can be manipulated. Adjustments might be necessary if `e` and `stepsize` are structured differently in your actual application.
- The predicates return either `true` or `false` depending on whether the specific key they check is pressed, aligning with the definition that predicates are functions returning a boolean value.
- Ensure that the environment variable `e` is properly updated in your actual system to reflect the current state of key presses for accurate functioning of the predicates.
