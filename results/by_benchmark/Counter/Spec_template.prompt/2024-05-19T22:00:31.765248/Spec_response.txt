Below is the TSL specification derived from the given natural language description, incorporating all the functions, predicates, and assumptions mentioned:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Mutual exclusion of button presses:
  !(pressA(e) && pressB(e));
  !(pressA(e) && pressC(e));
  !(pressB(e) && pressC(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Increment counter by stepsize upon pressing A:
  pressA(e) -> [count <- count + stepsize];

  // Increment counter by 2 upon pressing B:
  pressB(e) -> [count <- count + 2];

  // Increment counter by 3 upon pressing C:
  pressC(e) -> [count <- count + 3];

  // Update stepsize upon pressing A three times consecutively:
  pressA(e) && X(pressA(e) && X(pressA(e) && X(pressA(e))))
    -> [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)];
  
  // Reset stepsize to 1 upon pressing B or C:
  (pressB(e) || pressC(e)) -> [stepsize <- 1];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions**: We assume that no two button presses can occur at the same time, which is represented by mutual exclusion conditions for the button presses.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - **Incrementing the Counter**: When any of the buttons A, B, or C is pressed, the counter `count` is incremented by `stepsize`, `2`, and `3` respectively.
   - **Changing Stepsize**: After pressing button A three times consecutively, on the fourth consecutive press, the `stepsize` is multiplied by three. This uses nested `X` (next) operators to check for three consecutive presses.
   - **Resetting Stepsize**: Pressing either button B or C resets the `stepsize` to `1`.

This specification ensures that the operation of the buttons behaves as described, with step sizes adjusting appropriately based on the sequence of button presses.
