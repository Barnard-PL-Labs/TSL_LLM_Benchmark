Here's how you can implement the functions and predicates described using JavaScript. For the purposes of this example, Iâ€™ll also include an example setup on how you might simulate the test environment for these functions and predicates since we don't have a specified API to interact with:

### Functions Implementation

```javascript
function multiplyByThree(stepsize) {
    return stepsize * 3;
}
```

### Predicates Implementation

To check if a specific key ('a', 'b', or 'c') was pressed, we assume that the object `e` captures the keypress event. You would typically use an event listener in a real-world scenario to update the `e` object with the last pressed key. Here, I'll provide a mock-up for how these predicates might be used:

```javascript
function pressA(e) {
    return e.key === 'a';
}

function pressB(e) {
    return e.key === 'b';
}

function pressC(e) {
    return e.key === 'c';
}
```

### Testing Setup

Here's a simple setup to simulate keypress events and test the functions and predicates. This would typically be run in a browser environment:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
    const e = { key: event.key };
    console.log('Key pressed:', e.key);
    
    // Testing predicates
    if (pressA(e)) {
        console.log('Function A triggered: Counter incremented by', multiplyByThree(1));
    }
    if (pressB(e)) {
        console.log('Function B triggered: Counter incremented by', multiplyByThree(2));
    }
    if (pressC(e)) {
        console.log('Function C triggered: Counter incremented by', multiplyByThree(3));
    }
});

// Example of using the function directly
console.log('Multiply 10 by three:', multiplyByThree(10));
```

### Explanation:

1. **Functions**: `multiplyByThree` simply multiplies the given `stepsize` by 3.
2. **Predicates**: `pressA`, `pressB`, and `pressC` check if the key `a`, `b`, or `c` respectively was pressed by examining the `key` property of the event object `e`.
3. **Testing Setup**: Adds an event listener for the `keydown` event, which updates the `e` object to simulate a key press. Depending on which key is pressed, the respective predicate function is called, and the result of `multiplyByThree` function is logged to the console.

This setup helps in understanding how the implemented functions and predicates would work in a realistic scenario and provides immediate feedback on their behavior.
