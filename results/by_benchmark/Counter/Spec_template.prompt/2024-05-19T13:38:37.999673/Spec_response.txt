Here is the TSL specification based on your description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure that no two button presses occur simultaneously
  !(pressA(e) && pressB(e));
  !(pressA(e) && pressC(e));
  !(pressB(e) && pressC(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // When A is pressed, increment the counter by the current stepsize
  pressA(e) -> [count <- count + stepsize];

  // When B is pressed, increment the counter by 2 and reset stepsize to 1
  pressB(e) -> ([count <- count + 2] && [stepsize <- 1]);

  // When C is pressed, increment the counter by 3 and reset stepsize to 1
  pressC(e) -> ([count <- count + 3] && [stepsize <- 1]);

  // If A is pressed three times consecutively, on the fourth press, the stepsize is multiplied by three
  // This logic assumes a mechanism to count consecutive A presses, which must be expressed or handled elsewhere
  (pressA(e) && X(pressA(e)) && X(X(pressA(e))) && X(X(X(pressA(e))))) -> [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions**: The mutual exclusion between pressing any two buttons at the same time ensures that only one counter operation happens per unit of time.
2. **Guarantees**:
    - When the A button is pressed, the counter is incremented by the current value of `stepsize`.
    - When the B or C button is pressed, the counter is incremented by 2 or 3, respectively, and `stepsize` is reset to 1. 
    - The counter increment upon multiple consecutive presses of A increases the `stepsize` after the third consecutive press. This assumes a mechanism outside this core logic to count consecutive presses, which you would need to ensure elsewhere in system design or setup.

The TSL formulation captures the core functionality described, assuming a context where pressing sequences and the timing of button presses can be accurately tracked.
