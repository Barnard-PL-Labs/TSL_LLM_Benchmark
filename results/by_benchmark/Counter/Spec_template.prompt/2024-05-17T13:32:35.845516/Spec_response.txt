Here's how to translate the given natural language description into a Temporal Stream Logic (TSL) specification:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure that only one of the buttons can be pressed at any one time
  ! (pressA(e) && pressB(e));
  ! (pressA(e) && pressC(e));
  ! (pressB(e) && pressC(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Guarantee that pressing A increments the counter by stepsize
  pressA(e) -> [count <- count + stepsize];
  
  // Guarantee that pressing B increments the counter by 2
  pressB(e) -> [count <- count + 2];
  
  // Guarantee that pressing C increments the counter by 3
  pressC(e) -> [count <- count + 3];
  
  // Guarantee that pressing A three times in a row multiplies stepsize by three
  // Assuming a hidden state countA to track the number of consecutive A presses
  pressA(e) && X(pressA(e) && X(pressA(e) && !pressB(e) && !pressC(e)))
    -> X(X(X([stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)])));

  // Ensure stepsize resets to 1 if B or C is pressed
  (pressB(e) || pressC(e)) -> [stepsize <- 1];
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Assumptions**: This part specifies that the button presses are mutually exclusive. This ensures that no two operations (button presses) happen at the same time.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - **Press A Action**: Whenever the A button is pressed, it increments the `count` by the current `stepsize`.
   - **Press B Action**: Pressing B increments `count` by 2.
   - **Press C Action**: Pressing C increments `count` by 3.
   - **Triple A Press Action**: If A is pressed three times consecutively without B or C being pressed in between, the `stepsize` is multiplied by three. This logic assumes a way to track three consecutive presses, which might require additional state management (e.g., a counter for A presses) not explicit in this TSL fragment due to TSL's stateless nature.
   - **Reset Step Size**: If either B or C is pressed, `stepsize` is reset to 1.

Note: TSL does not natively support counting or maintaining continuous state without explicit state variables, which are abstracted out in this solution. For a real implementation, additional mechanisms to track consecutive button presses (like a counter for pressA) might be required.
