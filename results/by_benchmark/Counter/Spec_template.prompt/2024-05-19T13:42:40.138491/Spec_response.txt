Here's the TSL specification based on the description provided:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure that no two button operations can be performed at the same time
  !(pressA(e) && pressB(e));
  !(pressA(e) && pressC(e));
  !(pressB(e) && pressC(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // When pressA is pressed, increment the counter by the current stepsize
  pressA(e) -> ([count <- count + stepsize]);
  
  // When pressB is pressed, increment the counter by 2, reset stepsize to 1
  pressB(e) -> ([count <- count + 2] && [stepsize <- 1]);

  // When pressC is pressed, increment the counter by 3, reset stepsize to 1
  pressC(e) -> ([count <- count + 3] && [stepsize <- 1]);

  // When pressA is pressed three times in a row, on the fourth press, multiply stepsize by 3
  // Use a counter to track consecutive pressA events
  (pressA(e) && (consecutiveA == 0) -> X([consecutiveA <- 1]));
  (pressA(e) && (consecutiveA == 1) -> X([consecutiveA <- 2]));
  (pressA(e) && (consecutiveA == 2) -> X([consecutiveA <- 3]));
  (pressA(e) && (consecutiveA == 3) -> ([stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)] && [consecutiveA <- 0]));
  
  // Reset consecutiveA counter if B or C is pressed
  (pressB(e) || pressC(e)) -> [consecutiveA <- 0];
}
```

### Explanation:
- The assumptions block ensures mutual exclusion between the button presses, meaning no two buttons can be pressed simultaneously.
- The guarantees handle the effects of each button press. 
  - Pressing `A` increments the counter by the current `stepsize`.
  - Pressing `B` or `C` sets the `stepsize` back to 1 and increments the counter by 2 or 3, respectively.
  - To handle the requirement that pressing `A` three times consecutively alters the `stepsize`, a `consecutiveA` counter is used. Each press of `A` increments this counter, and on the fourth consecutive press, the `stepsize` is modified by multiplying it by three, and the counter is reset. Pressing `B` or `C` also resets this counter to 0.
