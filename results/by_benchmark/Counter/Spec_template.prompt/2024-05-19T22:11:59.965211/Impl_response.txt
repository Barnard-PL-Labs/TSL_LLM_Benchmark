To implement the methods described in JavaScript using the provided cells (`stepsize` and `e`), and adhering to your requirements, we need to define both functions and predicates. Below is the basic implementation:

### JavaScript Implementation

First, let's define the cells and functions:

```javascript
// Initial setup for cells
let stepsize = 1;
let e = { key: null };

// Functions
function multiplyByThree(stepsize) {
    return stepsize * 3;
}
```

Now, let's define the predicates that check whether specific keys ('a', 'b', 'c') are pressed based on the state of `e`. These predicates will return `true` if the correct key is pressed, otherwise `false`:

```javascript
// Predicates
function pressA(e) {
    return e.key === 'a';
}

function pressB(e) {
    return e.key === 'b';
}

function pressC(e) {
    return e.key === 'c';
}
```

### Example Usage

To demonstrate how these functions and predicates can be used in a program, hereâ€™s a simple example that listens to keydown events and updates the cell `e` accordingly. It also manages a counter that increments based on the key pressed:

```javascript
// Counter to increment based on key press
let counter = 0;

// Event listener for key presses
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
    e.key = event.key;  // Update the cell `e` with the currently pressed key
    if (pressA(e)) {
        counter += stepsize;  // Increment by stepsize
        console.log(`Key 'a' pressed. Counter incremented by ${stepsize}. New counter value: ${counter}`);
    } else if (pressB(e)) {
        stepsize = multiplyByThree(stepsize);  // Multiply stepsize by three
        console.log(`Key 'b' pressed. Step size updated to ${stepsize}`);
    } else if (pressC(e)) {
        stepsize = 1;  // Reset stepsize to 1
        console.log(`Key 'c' pressed. Step size reset to 1`);
    }
    // Reset e.key after handling the event
    e.key = null;
});
```

### Explanation

1. **Cells (`stepsize` and `e`)**: These are used to hold the current step size for incrementing the counter and the last key event state, respectively.
2. **Function (`multiplyByThree`)**: This function takes an integer and returns it multiplied by three. It is used to change the increment step size.
3. **Predicates (`pressA`, `pressB`, `pressC`)**: These functions check if a specific key ('a', 'b', or 'c') was pressed. They help in making decisions based on user input.
4. **Event Listener**: This listens for `keydown` events, updates the cell `e`, and performs actions based on which key was pressed, demonstrating the use of both the predicates and the function.

This setup allows you to have a dynamic response to user input, modifying the application state (`counter` and `stepsize`) based on different keys pressed, showcasing how functions and predicates can interact with an application's state effectively.
