### Explanation:
1. **Mutual Exclusion**: This is to ensure no two buttons can be pressed simultaneously, thereby avoiding any conflict in commands or counter updates.

2. **Guarantee on Button Presses**:
   - For `pressA(e)`: The counter is incremented by the current stepsize. A counter (`aPressCount`) tracks consecutive presses of the A button to handle the stepsize multiplication after every third consecutive press.
   - For `pressB(e)`: The counter is incremented by 2, and the stepsize is reset to 1.
   - For `pressC(e)`: The counter is incremented by 3, and the stepsize is reset to 1.
   
3. **Handling Consecutive A Presses**:
   - After three consecutive presses of the A button, the stepsize is multiplied by three using the `multiplyByThree(stepsize)` function. The counter `aPressCount` helps track the number of consecutive presses and is reset when either B or C is pressed or after multiplying the stepsize.

This setup ensures that the system behaves as described: incrementing counters based on button presses and modifying the stepsize based on certain button press patterns.
