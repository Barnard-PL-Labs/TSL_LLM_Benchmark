In JavaScript, you can implement the specified functions and predicates as follows. These functions will interact with the provided cell states `stepsize` and `e`:

### Functions
1. **multiplyByThree(stepsize):** Multiplies the value of `stepsize` by 3.

```javascript
function multiplyByThree(stepsize) {
    return stepsize * 3;
}
```

### Predicates
Predicates will check if a key 'a', 'b', or 'c' was pressed. Assuming `e` can provide information about which key was pressed, you can implement predicates to check for these key presses.

1. **pressA(e):** Returns `true` if the 'a' key was pressed.

```javascript
function pressA(e) {
    return e.key === 'a';
}
```

2. **pressB(e):** Returns `true` if the 'b' key was pressed.

```javascript
function pressB(e) {
    return e.key === 'b';
}
```

3. **pressC(e):** Returns `true` if the 'c' key was pressed.

```javascript
function pressC(e) {
    return e.key === 'c';
}
```

### Example Usage
To use the above functions and predicates effectively, you might often combine them with event listeners or other mechanisms that detect key presses, depending on the environment (such as a web browser). Hereâ€™s how you might set up a simple event listener in a browser to handle key presses:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
    const eventInfo = { key: event.key };

    // Check if specific keys are pressed and react accordingly
    if (pressA(eventInfo)) {
        console.log('Key A pressed');
        // Assume counter is a variable tracking some counter state
        counter += multiplyByThree(stepsize);
    } else if (pressB(eventInfo)) {
        console.log('Key B pressed');
    } else if (pressC(eventInfo)) {
        console.log('Key C pressed');
    }
});
```

This setup listens for any keydown event, checks if the key pressed is 'a', 'b', or 'c', and performs actions based on which key was pressed. For 'a', it increases a counter by three times the `stepsize` value. Note that you need to define `counter` and `stepsize` appropriately in your environment for this example to work correctly.
