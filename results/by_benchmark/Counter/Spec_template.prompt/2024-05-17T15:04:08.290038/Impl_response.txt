Based on your request, I'll provide JavaScript implementations for the specified functions and predicates using hypothetical behavior of the system API, as detailed information on how the API handles key presses and cell manipulations is not given.

### JavaScript Implementations

#### Functions

For the function `multiplyByThree(stepsize)`, we assume `stepsize` to be either a modifiable variable or accessible via a getter and setter if it's part of an environment where direct modification is not allowed. This function will multiply `stepsize` by 3.

```javascript
function multiplyByThree(stepsize) {
    return stepsize * 3;
}
```

#### Predicates

For the predicates (`pressA`, `pressB`, `pressC`), we assume there is an observable or retrievable way to determine if the keys 'A', 'B', or 'C' have been pressed. This might commonly be handled through event listeners in a browser environment, but as we are dealing with cells (`e`), I'll assume `e` is an object with properties that indicate whether each key is pressed.

```javascript
function pressA(e) {
    return e.aPressed;  // Assuming e.aPressed returns a boolean indicating if 'A' was pressed
}

function pressB(e) {
    return e.bPressed;  // Assuming e.bPressed returns a boolean indicating if 'B' was pressed
}

function pressC(e) {
    return e.cPressed;  // Assuming e.cPressed returns a boolean indicating if 'C' was pressed
}
```

### Example Usage

If you are working in an environment where you need to set up listeners or handlers for the key press actions, and if `e` is a global state object updated by these listeners, you would implement them like this:

```javascript
// Assuming a browser-like environment for simplicity
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
    if (event.key === 'a') {
        e.aPressed = true;
    } else if (event.key === 'b') {
        e.bPressed = true;
    } else if (event.key === 'c') {
        e.cPressed = true;
    }
});

document.addEventListener('keyup', function(event) {
    if (event.key === 'a') {
        e.aPressed = false;
    } else if (event.key === 'b') {
        e.bPressed = false;
    } else if (event.key === 'c') {
        e.cPressed = false;
    }
});
```

These functions and predicates can then be used in your system to control behavior based on the state of the key presses and modify data accordingly. If the environment details or API specifics differ, adjustments to these implementations may be necessary to suit actual API calls or data handling methods.
