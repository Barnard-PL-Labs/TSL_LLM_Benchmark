To implement the described functions and predicates in JavaScript, we need to establish a clear understanding of how the 'stepsize' and 'e' cells behave as well as how to interact with them. Based on the description, here's how you can define these functions and predicates:

### Functions:

#### `multiplyByThree(stepsize)`
This function multiplies the 'stepsize' by three. Assuming 'stepsize' is a variable holding a number, this function will simply perform a multiplication.

```javascript
function multiplyByThree(stepsize) {
    return stepsize * 3;
}
```

### Predicates:

#### `pressA(e)`
This predicate checks if the user pressed the 'A' key. Assuming 'e' is an event object which contains a property for the key pressed, this can be implemented as follows:

```javascript
function pressA(e) {
    return e.key === 'a' || e.key === 'A';
}
```

#### `pressB(e)`
Similar to `pressA`, this function checks if the 'B' key was pressed.

```javascript
function pressB(e) {
    return e.key === 'b' || e.key === 'B';
}
```

#### `pressC(e)`
This function checks if the 'C' key was pressed.

```javascript
function pressC(e) {
    return e.key === 'c' || e.key === 'C';
}
```

### Example Usage
Assuming you have an event listener set up for keypresses, you can use these functions and predicates like this:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
    if (pressA(event)) {
        console.log('A key pressed');
        // Example of using the function multiplyByThree with a fictive stepsize
        console.log('New stepsize if multiplied by three:', multiplyByThree(5));
    }
    if (pressB(event)) {
        console.log('B key pressed');
    }
    if (pressC(event)) {
        console.log('C key pressed');
    }
});
```

This code snippet listens for any key being pressed and uses the predicates to check which key was pressed, logging a message to the console and demonstrating how to use the `multiplyByThree` function. Note that this example uses a hardcoded value (`5`) to demonstrate multiplying a step size by three. This step size would typically be derived from application-specific state or user input in a real-world application.
