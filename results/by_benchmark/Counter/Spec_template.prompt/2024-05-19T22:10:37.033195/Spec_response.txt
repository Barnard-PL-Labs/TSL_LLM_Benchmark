This TSL specification defines the behavior of a system with three buttons (A, B, and C) that increment a counter by different amounts, with special rules for subsequent presses of button A. The assumptions ensure mutual exclusivity between button presses, and the guarantees specify the system's response to each type of button press, including resetting and modifying the step size based on the rules described.
