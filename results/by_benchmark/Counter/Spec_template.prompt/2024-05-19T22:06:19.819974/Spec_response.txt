```
always assume {
  // Ensuring only one button is pressed at any given time
  !(pressA(e) && pressB(e));
  !(pressA(e) && pressC(e));
  !(pressB(e) && pressC(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Increment counter by stepsize when A is pressed
  pressA(e) -> [count <- count + stepsize];

  // Increment counter by 2 when B is pressed
  pressB(e) -> [count <- count + 2];

  // Increment counter by 3 when C is pressed
  pressC(e) -> [count <- count + 3];

  // If A is pressed three times consecutively, the next press multiplies stepsize by three
  // We assume a mechanism to count consecutive presses, not directly expressible in basic TSL
  // Here we would implement a counter that resets on B or C press
  (X(pressA(e)) && X(X(pressA(e))) && X(X(X(pressA(e)))) && !pressB(e) && !pressC(e)) -> [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)];

  // Reset stepsize to 1 if B or C is pressed
  (pressB(e) || pressC(e)) -> [stepsize <- 1];
}
```

Note: This TSL specification assumes the existence of a mechanism to count consecutive button presses, which isn't directly supported by basic TSL constructs provided here. Thus, additional implementation details would be required to fully realize this behavior in an actual system.
