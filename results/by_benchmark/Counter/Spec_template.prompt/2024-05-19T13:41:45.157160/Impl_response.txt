To implement the required methods using JavaScript without a specific API wrapper, we need to make a few assumptions about the environment or how the "stepsize" and "e" cells are maintained and modified. Below are the implementations following these assumptions:

### Functions and Predicates Definitions

1. **`multiplyByThree(stepsize)`:** This function takes a value and multiplies it by three. We will assume that `stepsize` is either a global variable or passed directly to the function.

2. **`pressA(e)`, `pressB(e)`, `pressC(e)`:** These predicates check if specific keys ('a', 'b', 'c') are pressed. We will assume that `e` is an object representing an event, which contains information about which key was pressed.

### JavaScript Implementation

```javascript
// Assuming 'stepsize' is a global variable or it will be passed directly to the function
function multiplyByThree(stepsize) {
    return stepsize * 3;
}

// Predicate functions to check if specific keys are pressed
// Assuming 'e' is an event object provided during the key press event
function pressA(e) {
    return e.key === 'a';
}

function pressB(e) {
    return e.key === 'b';
}

function pressC(e) {
    return e.key === 'c';
}

// Example usage within an event listener context
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
    if (pressA(event)) {
        console.log("Key 'A' was pressed.");
        // Here you could use `multiplyByThree(stepsize)` if 'stepsize' is defined
        // For example, to modify something based on 'stepsize':
        // let newStepSize = multiplyByThree(stepsize);
        // console.log("New Step Size:", newStepSize);
    }

    if (pressB(event)) {
        console.log("Key 'B' was pressed.");
    }

    if (pressC(event)) {
        console.log("Key 'C' was pressed.");
    }
});
```

### Important Notes:

1. **Global Variables and Scope:** If `stepsize` is a global variable, it can be directly manipulated. However, if it's not global, you should ensure it's correctly passed and handled within the environment where the functions are used.

2. **Event Handling:** The key press detection assumes the use of an event object which is typical in browsers. Here, the `keydown` event is used to detect when a key is pressed.

3. **Testing and Debugging:** When implementing this code, you might need to test in an environment where key events can be triggered, such as a web browser. It will allow you to ensure that the key detection and function executions work as expected.

This setup provides a basic framework to handle the specified functionalities using JavaScript, with a focus on event handling and simple arithmetic operations.
