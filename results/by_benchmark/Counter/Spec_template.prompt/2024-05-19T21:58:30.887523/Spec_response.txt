Here's the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description and function/predicate list:

```
always assume {
  !(pressA(e) && pressB(e)) ;  // Mutual exclusion between pressA and pressB
  !(pressA(e) && pressC(e)) ;  // Mutual exclusion between pressA and pressC
  !(pressB(e) && pressC(e)) ;  // Mutual exclusion between pressB and pressC
}

always guarantee {
  pressA(e) -> [count <- count + stepsize]; // Increment counter by stepsize when A is pressed

  pressB(e) -> {
    [count <- count + 2];  // Increment counter by 2 when B is pressed
    [stepsize <- 1];      // Reset stepsize to 1 when B is pressed
  };

  pressC(e) -> {
    [count <- count + 3];  // Increment counter by 3 when C is pressed
    [stepsize <- 1];      // Reset stepsize to 1 when C is pressed
  };

  // Handling when A is pressed three consecutive times
  // Assuming a counter or mechanism to track consecutive A presses is implemented as "aPressCount"
  pressA(e) -> {
    [aPressCount <- aPressCount + 1]; // Increment A press count
    (aPressCount == 4) -> {           // If A is pressed four times in a row
      [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)];  // Multiply stepsize by three
      [aPressCount <- 0];             // Reset A press count
    };
    (pressB(e) || pressC(e)) -> [aPressCount <- 0]; // Reset A press count if B or C is pressed
  };
}
```

In this specification:
- Mutual exclusions ensure that no two buttons can be pressed at the same time.
- Pressing A increments the counter by `stepsize`.
- Pressing B or C increments the counter by 2 and 3, respectively, and resets `stepsize` to 1.
- If A is pressed three times consecutively, the fourth press multiplies the `stepsize` by three using the `multiplyByThree(stepsize)` function, and resets the count of consecutive A presses. This reset also happens if B or C is pressed any time after A has been pressed, ensuring that the sequence count for A is maintained correctly.
