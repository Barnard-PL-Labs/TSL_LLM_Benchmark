Given the description provided, it appears the task is to implement a set of JavaScript functions and predicates based on a hypothetical API. These functions interact with assumed variables `stepsize` and `e`, which represent system states for a counter's step increment value and input event state respectively.

Here is how we can implement the requested functions and predicates in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Functions
function multiplyByThree(stepsize) {
    return stepsize * 3;
}

// Predicates
function pressA(e) {
    // Assuming `e` is an object with keys representing button states
    // and values as booleans indicating whether the key is pressed
    return e.a === true;
}

function pressB(e) {
    // Similar assumption as pressA
    return e.b === true;
}

function pressC(e) {
    // Similar assumption as pressA
    return e.c === true;
}

// Example usage
// Assuming `stepsize` and `e` hold the following values:
let stepsize = 1;
let e = {
    a: true,  // "a" key is pressed
    b: false, // "b" key is not pressed
    c: false  // "c" key is not pressed
};

// Using the functions
let newStepsize = multiplyByThree(stepsize);
console.log(newStepsize); // Output: 3

// Using the predicates
console.log(pressA(e)); // Output: true
console.log(pressB(e)); // Output: false
console.log(pressC(e)); // Output: false
```

### Explanation:

1. **multiplyByThree(stepsize)**: This function simply multiplies the passed `stepsize` by 3.

2. **pressA(e)**, **pressB(e)**, **pressC(e)**: These predicates check the state of the `e` object, which is assumed to represent the state of input signals from a user interface or similar sources. They return `true` if the respective key is pressed (`true` in the object), otherwise `false`.

This implementation assumes that `e` is an object with boolean properties `a`, `b`, and `c`, each indicating whether a specific key is pressed. The exact structure of `e` and how it is updated or passed to these functions would depend on additional details from the API or the system's event handling mechanism, which are not provided in the description. In a real-world scenario, you might use event listeners or state management techniques to populate and update `e`.
