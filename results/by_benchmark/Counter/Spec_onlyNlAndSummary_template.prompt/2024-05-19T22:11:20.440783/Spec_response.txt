Here is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description for the button pressing scenario to increment counters:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure that no two button operations are performed at the same time
  !(pressA && pressB) && !(pressA && pressC) && !(pressB && pressC);
}

always guarantee {
  // When pressA is pushed, increment the counter by the current stepsize
  pressA -> [count <- count + stepsize];

  // When pressB is pushed, increment the counter by 2
  pressB -> [count <- count + 2];

  // When pressC is pushed, increment the counter by 3
  pressC -> [count <- count + 3];

  // When pressA is pushed three times in a row, the fourth press increases stepsize by 3 times
  // Use a counter to track consecutive presses of A and reset it on pressing B or C
  pressA -> (X (pressA && X (pressA && X (pressA && [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)])))) W (pressB || pressC);

  // When either pressB or pressC is pushed, set stepsize back to 1
  (pressB || pressC) -> [stepsize <- 1];
}
```

This TSL code specifies that the counter increments depend on which button is pressed and maintains conditions for changes in the increment size when the A button is pressed consecutively. The mutual exclusion of button presses is also guaranteed. The sequence of three consecutive A presses leading to a change in step size on the fourth press is tracked using nested next (X) operators and a weak until (W) to reset the step size when either B or C is pressed.
