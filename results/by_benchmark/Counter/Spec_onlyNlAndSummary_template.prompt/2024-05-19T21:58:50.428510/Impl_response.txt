To implement the described methods in JavaScript, we'll start by defining the `stepsize` and `e` variables along with the functions and predicates specified. Since the system API is unspecified, I'll assume basic handling for the key presses, and simulate this behavior.

### Step 1: Define Variables

```javascript
let stepsize = 1;  // stepsize starts at 1 each program start
let e = {};        // assuming 'e' will hold the state related to keypress events
```

### Step 2: Define Functions

```javascript
function multiplyByThree(stepsize) {
    return stepsize * 3;
}
```

### Step 3: Define Predicates

For the predicates related to key presses (`pressA`, `pressB`, `pressC`), assuming `e` will have properties like `aPressed`, `bPressed`, and `cPressed` which are boolean values indicating whether the respective keys are pressed:

```javascript
function pressA(e) {
    return !!e.aPressed;  // returns true if 'aPressed' is true
}

function pressB(e) {
    return !!e.bPressed;  // returns true if 'bPressed' is true
}

function pressC(e) {
    return !!e.cPressed;  // returns true if 'cPressed' is true
}
```

### Example Usage

Let's simulate a scenario where the 'a' key is pressed:

```javascript
// Simulating a key press event
e = { aPressed: true, bPressed: false, cPressed: false };

// Usage of predicates
console.log(pressA(e));  // Output: true
console.log(pressB(e));  // Output: false
console.log(pressC(e));  // Output: false

// Using the function to manipulate stepsize
let newStepsize = multiplyByThree(stepsize);
console.log(newStepsize);  // Output: 3
```

### Explanation

- The `stepsize` is a simple numeric value that starts at 1 each time the program is run.
- `e` is an object expected to hold the state of key presses. The predicates `pressA`, `pressB`, and `pressC` check the respective properties of `e` to determine if the corresponding key was pressed.
- The function `multiplyByThree` takes `stepsize` as an argument and multiplies it by 3.

This implementation assumes that `e` will reliably receive updates about the key press states from somewhere else in your application. If there's an event system or a loop that receives actual user input, `e` should be updated in that context to reflect the current state of key presses.
