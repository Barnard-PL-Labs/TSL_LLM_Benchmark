Here's the TSL specification based on the given natural language description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure that no two buttons are pressed at the same time
  !(pressA && pressB);
  !(pressA && pressC);
  !(pressB && pressC);
}

always guarantee {
  // Increment the counter by 1 when pressA is pressed
  pressA -> [count <- count + 1];
  
  // Increment the counter by 2 when pressB is pressed
  pressB -> [count <- count + 2];
  
  // Increment the counter by 3 when pressC is pressed
  pressC -> [count <- count + 3];
  
  // Handling the scenario where pressA is pressed three times in a row, then increases stepsize
  (X (pressA && X (pressA && X pressA))) -> [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)];
  
  // Reset stepsize to 1 if either pressB or pressC is pressed
  (pressB || pressC) -> [stepsize <- 1];

  // Ensure that the counter increments correctly after the stepsize has changed
  pressA -> [count <- count + stepsize];
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Assumptions**: This section ensures that the buttons A, B, and C are mutually exclusive in their activation, meaning that no two buttons can be pressed simultaneously.
  
- **Guarantees**: 
  - Each button press leads to an increment in the counter by a specific value. For `pressA`, it initially adds 1 to the counter, which is straightforward. However, if `pressA` is pressed three times consecutively, the `stepsize` used for incrementing the counter is modified by multiplying it by three.
  - The `pressB` and `pressC` buttons both reset the `stepsize` to 1 whenever they are pressed, ensuring that any modification made by consecutive `pressA` actions is reset.
  - The final guarantee ensures that any further presses of `pressA` after modifying the `stepsize` will use the new `stepsize` for incrementing the counter.
