Here's a TSL specification based on the natural language description provided:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Mutual exclusion for button pressing, ensuring no two counter operations are performed simultaneously
  !(pressA(e) && pressB(e));
  !(pressA(e) && pressC(e));
  !(pressB(e) && pressC(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Handling counter increments for each button press
  pressA(e) -> [count <- count + stepsize];
  pressB(e) -> ([count <- count + 2] && [stepsize <- 1]);
  pressC(e) -> ([count <- count + 3] && [stepsize <- 1]);

  // Adjusting the stepsize based on consecutive pressA occurrences
  ((pressA(e) && X(pressA(e)) && X(X(pressA(e)))) W pressB(e) || pressC(e))
    -> [stepsize <- stepsize * 3];

  // Reset stepsize to 1 when pressB or pressC is pressed
  (pressB(e) || pressC(e)) -> [stepsize <- 1];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions**:
   - The `always assume` block ensures that no two button presses can happen simultaneously, thus maintaining mutual exclusivity among the button operations.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - The `always guarantee` block defines the actions taken when each button is pressed:
     - **pressA**: Increments the counter by the current stepsize value.
     - **pressB** and **pressC**: Increment the counter by fixed values (2 and 3, respectively), and reset the stepsize to 1.
   - For handling the special condition of pressing the A key three times in a row, the expression utilizes a 'Weak Until' (W) to increase the stepsize only if the sequence is not broken by pressing B or C. If broken, the stepsize reset behavior triggered by the pressB or pressC will execute.
   
This specification captures both the individual and sequenced behaviors as described in the scenario, including the sequential dependency of the A button presses and the overriding reset of the stepsize by B or C button presses.
