Below is the TSL (Temporal Stream Logic) specification for the described scenario where a user interacts with buttons A, B, and C to increment a counter by varying amounts, with specific rules for changing the increment size on consecutive presses:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Mutual exclusion between button presses
  !(pressA && pressB);
  !(pressA && pressC);
  !(pressB && pressC);
}

always guarantee {
  // Increment count by stepsize when pressA is clicked
  pressA -> [count <- count + stepsize];

  // Increment count by 2 when pressB is clicked
  pressB -> [count <- count + 2];

  // Increment count by 3 when pressC is clicked
  pressC -> [count <- count + 3];

  // Increase stepsize by 3 times if pressA is clicked three times in a row
  (pressA && X (pressA && X (pressA))) -> [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)];

  // Reset stepsize to 1 if pressB or pressC is pressed
  (pressB || pressC) -> [stepsize <- 1];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Mutual Exclusion for Button Presses**: This ensures no two buttons can be pressed simultaneously, complying with the requirement that no two counter operations occur at the same time.
  
2. **Button Press Actions**:
   - **A Key**: When the A button is pressed, the counter is incremented by the current `stepsize`. The starting value of `stepsize` is 1.
   - **B Key**: When the B button is pressed, the counter is incremented by 2.
   - **C Key**: When the C button is pressed, the counter is incremented by 3.

3. **Stepsize Management**:
   - **Three Consecutive A Presses**: If the A button is pressed three times consecutively, the `stepsize` is multiplied by three. This uses temporal logic to check the sequence of button presses.
   - **Reset on B or C Press**: If either the B or C button is pressed, `stepsize` is reset to 1.

This TSL specification effectively models the scenario described, ensuring the counter behaves according to the rules laid out for the button presses and their effects on the increment size (stepsize).
