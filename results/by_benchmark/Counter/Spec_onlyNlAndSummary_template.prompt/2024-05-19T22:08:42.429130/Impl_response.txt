To implement the required functions and predicates in JavaScript, you'll need to design methods that interact with your described environment, particularly focusing on interacting with the cells "stepsize" and "e". Let's look at how these could be defined assuming the cells 'stepsize' and 'e' are accessible global variables or objects within your application context:

### JavaScript Implementation

```javascript
// Assuming the existence of a basic structure to interact with 'stepsize' and 'e'
let state = {
    stepsize: 1,
    e: {
        a: false,
        b: false,
        c: false
    }
};

// Function to multiply the stepsize by three
function multiplyByThree(stepsize) {
    return stepsize * 3;
}

// Predicate to check if the 'a' key was pressed
function pressA(e) {
    return e.a;
}

// Predicate to check if the 'b' key was pressed
function pressB(e) {
    return e.b;
}

// Predicate to check if the 'c' key was pressed
function pressC(e) {
    return e.c;
}

// Example of setting up event listeners to modify 'e' based on key presses
document.addEventListener('keydown', (event) => {
    if (event.key === 'a') {
        state.e.a = true;
    } else if (event.key === 'b') {
        state.e.b = true;
    } else if (event.key === 'c') {
        state.e.c = true;
    }
});

document.addEventListener('keyup', (event) => {
    if (event.key === 'a') {
        state.e.a = false;
    } else if (event.key === 'b') {
        state.e.b = false;
    } else if (event.key === 'c') {
        state.e.c = false;
    }
});
```

### Explanation:

1. **State Definition**: We define a simple state object to hold the values of `stepsize` and `e`. This state object mimics the cells described.
2. **multiplyByThree Function**: This function takes an integer and returns it multiplied by three. It operates on the `stepsize` value.
3. **Predicates (pressA, pressB, pressC)**: These functions take an object `e` which contains boolean values for each key ('a', 'b', 'c') and return true if the specific key is pressed.
4. **Event Listeners**: To simulate the behavior of the environment where 'e' changes based on user input (key presses), listeners for 'keydown' and 'keyup' events modify the properties of `state.e` accordingly. This part is crucial for real-time applications where the state of 'e' changes as the user interacts with the keyboard.

This setup provides a basic framework for implementing the required functions and predicates within an interactive JavaScript environment. Adjustments might be needed based on the actual implementation details of your environment and application needs.
