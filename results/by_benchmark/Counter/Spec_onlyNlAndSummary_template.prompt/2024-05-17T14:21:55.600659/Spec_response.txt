```tsl
always assume {
  // Mutual exclusion for button presses to ensure no two operations happen at the same time
  !(pressA && pressB);
  !(pressA && pressC);
  !(pressB && pressC);
}

always guarantee {
  // When pressA is pushed, increment the counter by stepsize
  pressA -> [count <- count + stepsize];
  
  // When pressB is pushed, increment the counter by 2 and reset stepsize to 1
  pressB -> ([count <- count + 2] && [stepsize <- 1]);
  
  // When pressC is pushed, increment the counter by 3 and reset stepsize to 1
  pressC -> ([count <- count + 3] && [stepsize <- 1]);
  
  // When pressA is pushed three times in a row, change stepsize to 3 times its current value
  // A variable 'aCount' is used to keep track of consecutive A key presses
  pressA -> (
    [aCount <- aCount + 1] &&
    (aCount = 3 -> [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)] && [aCount <- 0])
  );
  
  // When either pressB or pressC is pushed, reset stepsize to 1 and reset consecutive A press counter
  (pressB || pressC) -> ([stepsize <- 1] && [aCount <- 0]);
}
```

This TSL specification outlines the assumptions and guarantees corresponding to the behavior described in the natural language description. It ensures counters are appropriately incremented based on button presses, and that changes to the stepsize occur as specified when the A key is pressed consecutively three times. The usage of a counter (`aCount`) for consecutive A presses helps in managing the stepsize change, and mutual exclusion ensures that no two buttons can be pressed simultaneously.
