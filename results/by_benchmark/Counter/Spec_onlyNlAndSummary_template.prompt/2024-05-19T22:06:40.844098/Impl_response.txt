Given the requirements and the details provided, we can implement this system in JavaScript. We will assume that the `e` cell represents an object with properties reflecting the current state of different keys. We'll use hypothetical event listeners to simulate the pressing of keys, which update this state. We also maintain a `stepsize` variable that starts at 1 on each program start.

Here's a possible implementation using straightforward JavaScript:

```javascript
// Cells
let stepsize = 1;
let e = {
    a: false,
    b: false,
    c: false
};

// Functions
function multiplyByThree(value) {
    return value * 3;
}

// Predicates (returning boolean values based on the state of `e`)
function pressA(e) {
    return e.a;
}

function pressB(e) {
    return e.b;
}

function pressC(e) {
    return e.c;
}

// Simulating key presses using event listeners (assuming keys a, b, c)
document.addEventListener('keydown', (event) => {
    if (event.key === 'a') {
        e.a = true;
    } else if (event.key === 'b') {
        e.b = true;
    } else if (event.key === 'c') {
        e.c = true;
    }
});

document.addEventListener('keyup', (event) => {
    if (event.key === 'a') {
        e.a = false;
    } else if (event.key === 'b') {
        e.b = false;
    } else if (event.key === 'c') {
        e.c = false;
    }
});

// Example usage
document.addEventListener('keydown', (event) => {
    if (pressA(e)) {
        console.log(`Key 'a' was pressed. Counter incremented by: ${stepsize}`);
        stepsize = multiplyByThree(stepsize);  // Update stepsize each time 'a' is pressed
    } else if (pressB(e)) {
        console.log(`Key 'b' was pressed. Resetting stepsize.`);
        stepsize = 1;  // Reset stepsize when 'b' is pressed
    } else if (pressC(e)) {
        console.log(`Key 'c' was pressed. No action defined.`);
    }
});
```

In this implementation:
- We define the `stepsize` and the initial state of `e`.
- We provide functions to multiply the `stepsize` by 3 and predicates to check if specific keys were pressed.
- We simulate key press actions with event listeners. On pressing 'a', the counter is increased, and the `stepsize` is manipulated as per the function.
- We log messages to the console to demonstrate how the system responds to different key presses.

This setup is simplistic and designed for demonstration purposes. In a real-world application, you might need to integrate more robust state management and event handling depending on the complexity of the system and the environment (e.g., a browser or a Node.js application).
