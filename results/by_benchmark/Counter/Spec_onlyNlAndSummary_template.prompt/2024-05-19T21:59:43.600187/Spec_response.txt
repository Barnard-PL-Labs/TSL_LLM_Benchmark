Here is the TSL specification based on the natural language description provided:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Define the mutual exclusivity of button presses
  !(pressA && pressB);
  !(pressA && pressC);
  !(pressB && pressC);
}

always guarantee {
  // When the A button is pressed, increment the counter by 'stepsize'
  pressA -> [count <- count + stepsize];

  // When the B button is pressed, increment the counter by 2
  pressB -> [count <- count + 2];

  // When the C button is pressed, increment the counter by 3
  pressC -> [count <- count + 3];

  // Continuous press of A key three times in a row changes the stepsize
  (pressA && (X (pressA && (X (pressA))))) -> (X (X (X [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)])));

  // Reset the stepsize to 1 when either the B or C button is pressed
  (pressB || pressC) -> [stepsize <- 1];
}
```

This code assumes the following functions and variables:
- `pressA`, `pressB`, `pressC` are boolean variables that are `true` when the respective button is pressed.
- `multiplyByThree(x)` is a function that multiplies `x` by 3.
- `count` is the counter variable that increments by `stepsize`, 2, or 3, depending on which button is pressed.
- `stepsize` is a variable that initially starts at 1 and changes according to the conditions specified.
