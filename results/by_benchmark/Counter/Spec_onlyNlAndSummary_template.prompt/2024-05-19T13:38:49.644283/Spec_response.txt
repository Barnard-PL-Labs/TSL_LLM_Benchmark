Here is the TSL specification based on your description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Mutual exclusion for button presses
  !(pressA && pressB);
  !(pressA && pressC);
  !(pressB && pressC);
}

always guarantee {
  // When pressA is pushed, increment count by 1 or the current stepsize
  pressA -> [count <- count + stepsize];

  // When pressB is pushed, increment count by 2
  pressB -> [count <- count + 2];

  // When pressC is pushed, increment count by 3
  pressC -> [count <- count + 3];

  // Step size management for pressA being pressed three times in a row
  (pressA && X(pressA && X(pressA))) -> X X X ([stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)]);

  // Reset stepsize to 1 if pressB or pressC is pressed
  (pressB || pressC) -> [stepsize <- 1];
}
```

Explanation:

- **Assumptions**: This section ensures that no two button presses occur simultaneously, which would conflict with each other.

- **Guarantees**:
  - When `pressA` is activated, it increments the counter by `stepsize`. Initially, `stepsize` should be set to `1`.
  - When `pressB` is pressed, it directly increments the counter by `2`.
  - When `pressC` is pressed, it directly increments the counter by `3`.
  - The stepsize is increased to three times its current value if `pressA` is pressed three consecutive times.
  - The stepsize resets to `1` if either `pressB` or `pressC` is pressed, ensuring the increment mechanism for `pressA` is reset. 

This setup handles the dynamic change of the increment value (`stepsize`) based on specific consecutive inputs, as well as the immediate response to pressing any of the buttons in terms of updating the counter.
