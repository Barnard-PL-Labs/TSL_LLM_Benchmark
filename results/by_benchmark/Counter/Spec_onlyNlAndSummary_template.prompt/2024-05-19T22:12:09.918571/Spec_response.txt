Here is the corresponding TSL code based on the described functionality:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Mutual exclusion for button presses
  !(pressA && pressB);
  !(pressA && pressC);
  !(pressB && pressC);
}

always guarantee {
  // Increment counter by stepsize when pressA is pressed
  pressA -> [count <- count + stepsize];
  
  // Increment counter by 2 when pressB is pressed
  pressB -> [count <- count + 2];
  
  // Increment counter by 3 when pressC is pressed
  pressC -> [count <- count + 3];

  // Triple the stepsize after three consecutive pressA without pressB or pressC
  (pressA && X(pressA && X(pressA))) -> X(X(X(stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)) W (pressB || pressC)));

  // Reset stepsize to 1 if pressB or pressC is pressed
  (pressB || pressC) -> [stepsize <- 1];
}
```

Explanation:

- **Mutual Exclusion**: The assumptions section ensures that no two buttons are pressed at the same time.
- **Incrementing Count**: Each button increases the `count` by a fixed amount. For `pressA`, the increment is by the current `stepsize`; for `pressB` and `pressC`, the increments are by 2 and 3, respectively.
- **Adjusting Stepsize**: After pressing the A key three consecutive times without an intervening B or C key press, the stepsize is multiplied by three. This is captured using the temporal operator `X` (next) to chain the condition across three states. The `W` (weak until) operator ensures that this adjustment only happens if no B or C key is pressed in between these states.
- **Resetting Stepsize**: If either `pressB` or `pressC` is pressed, the stepsize is reset to 1 immediately. This is implemented with a direct assignment within the corresponding conditions.
