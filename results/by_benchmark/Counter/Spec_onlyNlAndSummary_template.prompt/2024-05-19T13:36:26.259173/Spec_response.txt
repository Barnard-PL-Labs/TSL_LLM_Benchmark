```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure no two button operations are performed at the same time
  !(pressA && pressB) && !(pressA && pressC) && !(pressB && pressC);
}

always guarantee {
  // Increment counter by 1 when A is pressed
  pressA -> [count <- count + 1];

  // Increment counter by 2 when B is pressed
  pressB -> [count <- count + 2];

  // Increment counter by 3 when C is pressed
  pressC -> [count <- count + 3];

  // Handling the stepsize increase when A is pressed three times in a row
  (pressA && X(pressA && X(pressA))) -> [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)];

  // Reset stepsize to 1 when either B or C is pressed
  (pressB || pressC) -> [stepsize <- 1];
}
```

This TSL specification captures the requirements described for the button presses affecting a counter and managing a variable stepsize. The "always assume" section ensures mutual exclusivity between button presses, while the "always guarantee" section implements the logic for counting and stepsize adjustments.
