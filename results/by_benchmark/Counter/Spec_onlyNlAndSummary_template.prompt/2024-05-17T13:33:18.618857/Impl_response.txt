Since the exact details of the System API are not provided, we will create JavaScript functions based on common ways these operations might be implemented. We are assuming that the "stepsize" and "e" are part of some environment that can be manipulated through JavaScript. Furthermore, we'll assume that "e" might contain some form of input or event data that indicates which key has been pressed.

We'll create JavaScript function definitions for "multiplyByThree", and predicates "pressA", "pressB", "pressC" based on typical web application implementations.

```javascript
// Function to multiply the stepsize by 3
function multiplyByThree(stepsize) {
    return stepsize * 3;
}

// Predicate to check if the 'a' key was pressed
function pressA(e) {
    // Assuming 'e' might be an event object
    return e.key === 'a';
}

// Predicate to check if the 'b' key was pressed
function pressB(e) {
    // Assuming 'e' might be an event object
    return e.key === 'b';
}

// Predicate to check if the 'c' key was pressed
function pressC(e) {
    // Assuming 'e' might be an event object
    return e.key === 'c';
}
```

### Example Usage in an Event Listener Context
If you are using these functions in the context of a web application, you may want to use them with event listeners. Here's an example of how you might do that:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('keypress', function(event) {
    console.log("Key pressed: ", event.key);  // Log the key pressed

    // Use the predicates to check for specific keys
    if (pressA(event)) {
        console.log("A was pressed. Increment by:", multiplyByThree(1));  // Example usage with a step size
    }

    if (pressB(event)) {
        console.log("B was pressed.");
    }

    if (pressC(event)) {
        console.log("C was pressed.");
    }
});
```

This script sets up an event listener for keypress events on the entire document. When a key is pressed, it checks if it's 'a', 'b', or 'c' using the predicates and reacts accordingly. The `multiplyByThree` function is used in this example to manipulate a hypothetical "step size" when 'a' is pressed.

Note: The above example assumes a browser environment where `event.key` provides the identifier of the key pressed. If your environment differs (for instance, a server-side Node.js environment or a different type of client application), you'll need to adjust the data structure and event handling code according to your specific API and environment.
