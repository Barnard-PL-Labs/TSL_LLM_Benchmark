```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure that no two button operations can be performed at the same time
  !(pressA && pressB) && !(pressA && pressC) && !(pressB && pressC);
}

always guarantee {
  // Increment the counter by 1 when pressA is pushed
  pressA -> [count <- count + 1];
  
  // Increment the counter by 2 when pressB is pushed
  pressB -> [count <- count + 2];

  // Increment the counter by 3 when pressC is pushed
  pressC -> [count <- count + 3];
  
  // Triple the stepsize after pressA is pushed three times consecutively unless interrupted by pressB or pressC
  (pressA && X(pressA) && X(X(pressA)) && X(X(X(pressA && !(pressB || pressC))))) -> [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)];

  // Reset stepsize to 1 if either pressB or pressC is pushed
  (pressB || pressC) -> [stepsize <- 1];
}
```
This TSL specification adheres to the provided natural language description, setting up mutual exclusion for button presses and defining the specific behaviors for each button press in terms of counter incrementation and stepsize adjustments.
