Here is the TSL specification based on the natural language description provided:

```TSL
always assume {
  // Assure that no two button operations can happen at the same time
  !(pressA && pressB);
  !(pressA && pressC);
  !(pressB && pressC);
}

always guarantee {
  // Define the counter increment logic for each button press
  pressA -> [count <- count + stepsize];
  pressB -> [count <- count + 2];
  pressC -> [count <- count + 3];

  // Step size adjustment logic based on consecutive A presses and reset by B or C
  // Tracking consecutive A presses with a variable `aCount`
  pressA -> [aCount <- aCount + 1];
  (pressB || pressC) -> [aCount <- 0] && [stepsize <- 1];
  
  // If A is pressed three times consecutively, multiply stepsize by 3
  (aCount == 3) -> [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)] && [aCount <- 0];
}
```

This TSL specification incorporates the following elements:
- Mutual exclusion for button presses to ensure no conflicting operations occur simultaneously.
- Counter incrementation is specified for each button.
- Consecutive A button presses change the increment step size, which resets if either B or C is pressed.
- Use of additional variables (`aCount` for counting consecutive A presses and `stepsize` for tracking the increment multiplier) to handle the special conditions stated in the requirements.
