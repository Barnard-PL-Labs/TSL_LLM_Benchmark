Here is the TSL specification based on the natural language description provided:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure that no two buttons are pressed simultaneously
  !(pressA && pressB) && !(pressA && pressC) && !(pressB && pressC);
}

always guarantee {
  // Increment counter by 1 when A is pressed
  pressA -> [count <- count + 1];
  
  // Increment counter by 2 when B is pressed
  pressB -> [count <- count + 2];
  
  // Increment counter by 3 when C is pressed
  pressC -> [count <- count + 3];
  
  // If A is pressed three times in a row, increase stepsize by multiplying by three
  (X (pressA && X (pressA && X pressA))) -> X [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)] W (!pressA || pressB || pressC);
  
  // Reset stepsize to 1 when B or C is pressed
  (pressB || pressC) -> [stepsize <- 1];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions Section:**
   - Ensures mutual exclusivity between button presses, meaning no two buttons can be pressed at the same time.

2. **Guarantees Section:**
   - Each button press results in an increment of the `count` variable by a specific value (1, 2, or 3) depending on the button pressed.
   - Pressing the `A` button three times consecutively triples the `stepsize` on the next press of `A`, but this is only in effect until any other button (`B` or `C`) is pressed or `A` is not pressed immediately next.
   - Pressing either `B` or `C` resets the `stepsize` to 1.

This TSL specification aligns with the requirements described, managing the counter increments based on button sequences and ensuring specific actions reset or modify the increment behavior as defined.
