Here is the TSL specification based on the natural language description provided:

```TSL
always assume {
  // Mutual exclusion: only one button can be pressed at a time
  !(pressA && pressB) &&
  !(pressA && pressC) &&
  !(pressB && pressC);
}

always guarantee {
  // Increment counter by current stepsize when A is pressed
  pressA -> [count <- count + stepsize];

  // Increment counter by 2 when B is pressed
  pressB -> [count <- count + 2];

  // Increment counter by 3 when C is pressed
  pressC -> [count <- count + 3];

  // Step size increases to three times its current value after pressing A three times in a row
  (X(X(X(pressA && !pressB && !pressC) && pressA && !pressB && !pressC) && pressA && !pressB && !pressC)) ->
    [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)];

  // Reset stepsize to 1 when either B or C is pressed
  (pressB || pressC) -> [stepsize <- 1];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. In the "always assume" block:
   - Mutual exclusion is implemented to ensure that no two buttons can be pressed simultaneously.

2. In the "always guarantee" block:
   - Each button press updates the "count" variable by a specified amount: `stepsize` for button A (which starts at 1), 2 for button B, and 3 for button C.
   - If button A is pressed three times consecutively without pressing B or C in between, the `stepsize` is multiplied by three. This is checked using three consecutive states with button A pressed and neither B nor C.
   - Pressing either button B or C resets the `stepsize` to 1.

This TSL specification captures the logic described in the natural language description regarding the interactions of button presses and their effects on a counter and stepsize.
