Here is the translation of the given natural language description into a TSL specification:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure mutual exclusion of pressing buttons A, B, and C
  !(pressA && pressB);
  !(pressA && pressC);
  !(pressB && pressC);
}

always guarantee {
  // Incrementing the counter by the step size when A is pressed
  pressA -> [count <- count + stepsize];

  // Incrementing the counter by 2 when B is pressed
  pressB -> [count <- count + 2];

  // Incrementing the counter by 3 when C is pressed
  pressC -> [count <- count + 3];

  // If A is pressed three consecutive times, multiply stepsize by 3
  (pressA && X(pressA && X(pressA))) -> X(X(X([stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)])));

  // If B or C is pressed, reset stepsize to 1
  (pressB || pressC) -> [stepsize <- 1];

  // Initialize stepsize to 1 when the system starts
  [stepsize <- 1];
}
```

In this solution:
- We ensure that no two buttons can be pressed together using mutual exclusions in the `assume` section.
- The `guarantee` section covers the operations of incrementing the counter based on the button pressed and adjusting the step size accordingly.
- The increment upon triple consecutive presses of button A is handled through a nested temporal operator `X`, ensuring the condition is met only after three consecutive presses.
- The system initializes with a step size of 1, ensuring the initial condition is set correctly.
