```
always assume {
  // Define the exclusive relationship between pressing the A, B, and C keys
  !(pressA(e) && pressB(e));
  !(pressA(e) && pressC(e));
  !(pressB(e) && pressC(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Handle the pressA operation
  pressA(e) -> {
    [count <- count + stepsize];
    // Check if A was pressed three times in a row
    (pressA(e) && X(pressA(e) && X(pressA(e)))) -> [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)];
    // Reset stepsize if B or C is pressed
    (pressB(e) || pressC(e)) -> [stepsize <- 1];
  };
  
  // Handle the pressB operation
  pressB(e) -> {
    [count <- count + 2];
    [stepsize <- 1];
  };
  
  // Handle the pressC operation
  pressC(e) -> {
    [count <- count + 3];
    [stepsize <- 1];
  };
}
```

This TSL specification encapsulates the logic laid out in the natural language description, setting up the initial assumptions about mutual exclusivity of button presses and specifying the guarantees for what happens when each button is pressed, particularly focusing on how the `stepsize` variable is modified in response to sequences of pressing the A button or pressing either the B or C buttons.
