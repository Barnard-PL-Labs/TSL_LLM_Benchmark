To implement the required functions and predicates in JavaScript, you would first define the function `multiplyByThree` that takes a cell `stepsize` and multiplies its value by 3. For the predicates `pressA`, `pressB`, and `pressC`, you would check if the cell `e` contains specific values representing whether the "a", "b", or "c" key was pressed, respectively.

Here is how you can implement these in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Assuming 'stepsize' and 'e' are accessible as global variables or via some context

/**
 * Function to multiply the stepsize by 3.
 * @param {number} stepsize - The current step size.
 * @return {number} - The step size multiplied by three.
 */
function multiplyByThree(stepsize) {
    return stepsize * 3;
}

/**
 * Predicate to check if the 'a' key was pressed.
 * @param {string} e - The event or state string indicating which key was pressed.
 * @return {boolean} - True if 'a' key was pressed, false otherwise.
 */
function pressA(e) {
    return e === 'a';
}

/**
 * Predicate to check if the 'b' key was pressed.
 * @param {string} e - The event or state string indicating which key was pressed.
 * @return {boolean} - True if 'b' key was pressed, false otherwise.
 */
function pressB(e) {
    return e === 'b';
}

/**
 * Predicate to check if the 'c' key was pressed.
 * @param {string} e - The event or state string indicating which key was pressed.
 * @return {boolean} - True if 'c' key was pressed, false otherwise.
 */
function pressC(e) {
    return e === 'c';
}

// Example usage:
console.log(multiplyByThree(5));  // Output: 15
console.log(pressA('a'));         // Output: true
console.log(pressB('a'));         // Output: false
console.log(pressC('c'));         // Output: true
```

In this example, the `multiplyByThree` function simply multiplies the given `stepsize` value by 3 and returns the result. Each of the predicates returns a boolean indicating whether the specific key ('a', 'b', or 'c') was pressed based on the value of `e`.

Make sure the values you test with (like the example usage) are representative of how `stepsize` and `e` are set and changed in the actual system you're working with. Adjust based on how these values are updated and accessed in your specific implementation context.
