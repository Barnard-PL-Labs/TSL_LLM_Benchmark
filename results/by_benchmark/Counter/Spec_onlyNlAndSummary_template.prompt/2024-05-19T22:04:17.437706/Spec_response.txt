Here's a TSL specification that models the scenario described in natural language about buttons A, B, and C affecting a counter and step size:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure that no two button operations happen at the same time
  !(pressA && pressB);
  !(pressA && pressC);
  !(pressB && pressC);
}

always guarantee {
  // Increment the counter by the step size when A is pressed
  pressA -> {
    [count <- count + stepsize];
    // If A is pressed three times consecutively, multiply stepsize by three on the next press
    [pressAcount <- pressAcount + 1] W (pressB || pressC);
    (pressAcount == 3) -> [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)];
  };
  
  // Reset the pressAcount and stepsize when B or C is pressed
  (pressB || pressC) -> {
    [pressAcount <- 0];
    [stepsize <- 1];
  };

  // Increment the counter by 2 when B is pressed
  pressB -> [count <- count + 2];

  // Increment the counter by 3 when C is pressed
  pressC -> [count <- count + 3];
}
```

Explanation:
- **Assumptions** ensure that no two button presses can occur simultaneously.
- **Guarantees** handle the incrementing of the counter based on which button is pressed. The counter is incremented by a dynamic `stepsize` when A is pressed, by 2 when B is pressed, and by 3 when C is pressed.
- The `stepsize` is updated based on how many consecutive times A has been pressed, and is reset when either B or C is pressed.
- A separate variable `pressAcount` is used to track consecutive presses of the A button to determine when to update the `stepsize`.
