Here is the translation of the provided natural language description into a TSL (Temporal Stream Logic) specification:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Mutual exclusion for button presses to ensure that no two counter operations happen at the same time
  !(pressA(e) && pressB(e));
  !(pressA(e) && pressC(e));
  !(pressB(e) && pressC(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // When the A key is pressed, increment the counter by 'stepsize' (default is 1)
  pressA(e) -> [count <- count + stepsize];

  // When the B key is pressed, increment the counter by 2
  pressB(e) -> [count <- count + 2];

  // When the C key is pressed, increment the counter by 3
  pressC(e) -> [count <- count + 3];

  // Reset the stepsize to 1 if B or C is pressed
  (pressB(e) || pressC(e)) -> [stepsize <- 1];

  // Manage the stepsize if A is pressed three times consecutively
  (X(pressA(e)) && X(X(pressA(e))) && X(X(X(pressA(e))))) -> [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions**: Ensure mutual exclusivity between the button presses to comply with the constraint that no two operations can happen simultaneously.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - Increment the `count` variable appropriately based on which button is pressed (`pressA`, `pressB`, `pressC`).
   - The `stepsize` variable, which affects the increment of `count` when `pressA` is used, starts as 1. When either `pressB` or `pressC` is pressed at any time, it is reset to 1.
   - To handle the special case where the `A` key is pressed three times in a row, `stepsize` is then changed by multiplying it by three, enhancing the increment effect for subsequent `pressA` actions. The function `multiplyByThree(stepsize)` is a placeholder for the actual function or operation that increases the stepsize by three times. Adjust this to fit the actual programming environment or specification details. This increment change only occurs after three consecutive `A` presses without an interruption by `B` or `C`.
