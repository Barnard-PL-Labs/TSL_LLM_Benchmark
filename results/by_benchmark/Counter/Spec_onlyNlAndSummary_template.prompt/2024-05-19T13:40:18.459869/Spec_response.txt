Here is the TSL specification based on the natural language description provided:

```TSL
always assume {
  // Mutual exclusion of button presses: no two buttons can be pressed at the same time
  !(pressA(e) && pressB(e));
  !(pressA(e) && pressC(e));
  !(pressB(e) && pressC(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Increment counter by 1 when A is pressed
  pressA(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

  // Increment counter by 2 when B is pressed
  pressB(e) -> [count <- count + 2];

  // Increment counter by 3 when C is pressed
  pressC(e) -> [count <- count + 3];

  // If A is pressed three times in a row, increase the stepsize by multiplying it by 3 on the fourth press
  (pressA(e) && X(pressA(e)) && X(X(pressA(e))) && X(X(X(pressA(e))))) -> [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)];

  // Reset stepsize to 1 if either B or C is pressed
  (pressB(e) || pressC(e)) -> [stepsize <- 1];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions** ensure that no two buttons can be pressed at the same time, which adheres to the requirement that no two counter operations can be performed simultaneously.
   
2. **Guarantees** handle the logic for incrementing the counter based on which button is pressed. Each button press results in a specific increment to the `count` variable as described.

3. The special condition for pressing the A key three times in a row is managed by checking for four consecutive presses of the A key. If this condition is met, the `stepsize` is increased by multiplying it by 3.

4. If either B or C is pressed, the `stepsize` is reset to 1, ensuring the system returns to the base increment level after any press of B or C.

This TSL specification should meet all the requirements of the scenario described.
