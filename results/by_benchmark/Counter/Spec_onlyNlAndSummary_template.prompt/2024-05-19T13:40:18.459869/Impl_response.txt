To provide a JavaScript implementation for the given requirements, we will define the "functions" and "predicates" as described. The predicates will check whether certain keys (a, b, or c) are pressed, and the function `multiplyByThree` will simply multiply the input, `stepsize`, by 3.

Since the problem statement includes a cell `e` which determines how the counter should act but doesn't define how `stepsize` is interacted with directly by the API, we'll consider `stepsize` as a variable that can be passed to functions. It's unclear from the context if `e` is an object, struct, or another form of data structure. For simplicity, we'll assume it's an object that may contain properties that indicate the state of key presses.

Here's a possible implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Assuming 'stepsize' is a numeric value representing the current step size of a counter.
// Example of a simple function that multiplies 'stepsize' by 3
function multiplyByThree(stepsize) {
    return stepsize * 3;
}

// Assuming 'e' is an object where key presses are recorded as boolean properties.
// Predicate functions to check if certain keys are pressed
function pressA(e) {
    return !!e.a; // returns true if 'a' is pressed, false otherwise
}

function pressB(e) {
    return !!e.b; // returns true if 'b' is pressed, false otherwise
}

function pressC(e) {
    return !!e.c; // returns true if 'c' is pressed, false otherwise
}

// Example interaction with the system:
let e = { a: false, b: true, c: false }; // Example state of 'e'
let stepsize = 10;

console.log("Original stepsize:", stepsize);
console.log("Multiplied by three:", multiplyByThree(stepsize));
console.log("Press A:", pressA(e));
console.log("Press B:", pressB(e));
console.log("Press C:", pressC(e));

// Changing the state of 'e' to simulate a key press
e.a = true;
console.log("After pressing A, Press A:", pressA(e));
```

### Explanation:
- `multiplyByThree`: A simple function that multiplies the given `stepsize` by 3.
- `pressA`, `pressB`, `pressC`: These functions check the properties `a`, `b`, and `c` of the object `e` respectively. Using `!!` ensures the return of a boolean value.
- The interaction example demonstrates how these functions might be used in practice, with a sample `e` object representing key states. 

This implementation assumes that the `e` object is appropriately updated elsewhere in your application to reflect the current key press states. If `e` should be updated based on real-time user input (like actual key presses), additional code involving event listeners for keyboard events would be necessary.
