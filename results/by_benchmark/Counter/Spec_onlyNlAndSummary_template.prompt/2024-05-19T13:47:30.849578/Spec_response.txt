To translate the described button interaction scenario into a TSL specification, we must ensure that the assumptions and guarantees are captured correctly. Here's how the TSL setup might look based on the provided description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Assume that no two button presses can happen at the same time
  !(pressA && pressB);
  !(pressA && pressC);
  !(pressB && pressC);
}

always guarantee {
  // Handling the counter increments for each button press
  pressA -> [count <- count + stepsize];
  pressB -> ([count <- count + 2] && [stepsize <- 1]);
  pressC -> ([count <- count + 3] && [stepsize <- 1]);

  // If pressA is pushed three times in a row, increase the stepsize by multiplying it by three
  (pressA && X(pressA && X(pressA && X(pressA))))
    -> [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)];

  // Reset stepsize to 1 when either pressB or pressC is pushed
  (pressB || pressC) -> [stepsize <- 1];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions Section**: We ensure mutual exclusivity between the button presses to satisfy the requirement that no two counter operations can be performed simultaneously.

2. **Guarantees Section**:
   - **Counter Increment**: Each button press leads to a different increment of the counter variable `count`. For button A, the increment is determined by the current `stepsize`, whereas buttons B and C have fixed increments of 2 and 3, respectively.
   - **Stepsize Adjustment**:
     - When button A is pressed three times in a row, the `stepsize` is multiplied by three on the fourth consecutive press. This is represented by a temporal sequence check using `X` (next) operators nested to check the condition of three consecutive presses.
     - Both button B and C presses reset the `stepsize` to 1 immediately after being pressed.
