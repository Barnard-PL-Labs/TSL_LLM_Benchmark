To implement the described methods in JavaScript, we'll define functions and predicates based on the descriptions provided. We'll assume that the cell states for "stepsize" and "e" are represented by variables that are updated by some external system or user interaction. The "pressA", "pressB", and "pressC" predicates will determine if specific keys were pressed, based on the state in "e".

Here's a sample implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Cell variables
let stepsize = 1; // Initializes stepsize to 1 each program start
let e = { a: false, b: false, c: false }; // Example state of 'e' indicating if keys are pressed

// Functions
function multiplyByThree(stepsize) {
  return stepsize * 3;
}

// Predicates (assuming 'e' is an object with properties 'a', 'b', 'c' that are true when the respective keys are pressed)
function pressA(e) {
  return e.a;
}

function pressB(e) {
  return e.b;
}

function pressC(e) {
  return e.c;
}

// Example usage
console.log("Stepsize: ", stepsize);
console.log("Multiplied by Three: ", multiplyByThree(stepsize));

// Simulating key presses
e = { a: true, b: false, c: false };
console.log("Press A: ", pressA(e)); // Expected: true
console.log("Press B: ", pressB(e)); // Expected: false
console.log("Press C: ", pressC(e)); // Expected: false

// Update stepsize based on the multiplication function
stepsize = multiplyByThree(stepsize);
console.log("Updated Stepsize: ", stepsize);
```

### Explanation:
1. **Cell Variables**: `stepsize` and `e` are defined as global variables. `stepsize` starts at 1, and `e` is an object initially set with all keys not pressed (`false`). The structure of `e` allows us to easily check the state of each key ('a', 'b', 'c').

2. **Functions**:
   - `multiplyByThree(stepsize)`: Takes `stepsize` as an argument and returns its value multiplied by three.

3. **Predicates**:
   - `pressA(e)`, `pressB(e)`, `pressC(e)`: Check the state of `e` to determine if 'a', 'b', or 'c' keys are pressed, respectively.

4. **Example Usage**: Demonstrates how the functions and predicates can be used. It includes simulation of key presses by directly modifying the `e` object and applying the function to update `stepsize`.

This example assumes that the key press states (`a`, `b`, `c`) are updated elsewhere in your system, possibly by event listeners or another form of input handling. Adjustments may be needed depending on the actual system API and environment.
