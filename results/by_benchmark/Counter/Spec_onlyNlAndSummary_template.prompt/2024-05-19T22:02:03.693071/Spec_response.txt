Here is how you would translate the provided natural language description into a TSL specification:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Only one button can be pressed at a time
  !(pressA && pressB);
  !(pressA && pressC);
  !(pressB && pressC);
}

always guarantee {
  // When A is pressed, increment the counter by the current stepsize
  pressA -> [count <- count + stepsize];

  // When B is pressed, increment the counter by 2 and reset stepsize to 1
  pressB -> ([count <- count + 2] && [stepsize <- 1]);

  // When C is pressed, increment the counter by 3 and reset stepsize to 1
  pressC -> ([count <- count + 3] && [stepsize <- 1]);

  // If A is pressed three times in a row, multiply stepsize by 3 on the next press
  (X (pressA) && X (X (pressA)) && X (X (X (pressA))) && !pressB && !pressC)
    -> (X (X (X (X [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)]))));

  // Reset stepsize to 1 if B or C is pressed
  (pressB || pressC) -> [stepsize <- 1];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions** ensure that only one of the three buttons (A, B, or C) can be pressed at any given time, preventing simultaneous operations which could lead to race conditions or undefined behaviors.

2. **Guarantees** are defined for:
   - **pressA**: Increments the "count" variable by "stepsize", which is dynamically adjusted.
   - **pressB and pressC**: Increments the "count" by fixed values of 2 and 3 respectively, and resets the "stepsize" to 1 regardless of its previous value.
   - **Repeated A presses**: If A is pressed three successive times without intervening presses of B or C, the step size is increased by a factor of three on the fourth press. This is achieved using nested next (X) operators to check the sequence of button presses.
   - **Button B or C presses**: Resets the stepsize to 1 immediately.

This configuration ensures that the requirements provided in the natural language description are fully captured and implemented in the TSL specification.
