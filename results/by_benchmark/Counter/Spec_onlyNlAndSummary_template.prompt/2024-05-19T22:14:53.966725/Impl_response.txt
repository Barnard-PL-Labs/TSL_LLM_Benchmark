To implement the described functionality using JavaScript, you can define both the functions and predicates as specified. Below is a sample implementation that demonstrates how you might set up these methods and interact with hypothetical "cells" and events. 

For the purpose of this example, I will assume a simple framework where changes to the `stepsize` and `event` (`e`) can be simulated or updated by other parts of the system. The actual linkage to real events (e.g., keypresses) would depend on the environment where this code is executed, such as a web page or a Node.js application.

```javascript
// Initialize the cell that stores the stepsize
let stepsize = 1;

// Function to simulate pressing keys
let eventState = { a: false, b: false, c: false };

// Function: Multiply stepsize by 3
function multiplyByThree() {
    stepsize *= 3;
    console.log(`New stepsize after multiplying by three: ${stepsize}`);
}

// Predicate: Check if the 'a' key was pressed
function pressA() {
    return eventState.a;
}

// Predicate: Check if the 'b' key was pressed
function pressB() {
    return eventState.b;
}

// Predicate: Check if the 'c' key was pressed
function pressC() {
    return eventState.c;
}

// Simulate key press
function simulateKeyPress(key) {
    // Reset all keys
    eventState = { a: false, b: false, c: false };

    // Set the pressed key to true
    if (eventState.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
        eventState[key] = true;
        console.log(`Key ${key} pressed`);
    }
}

// Example usage
console.log("Starting stepsize:", stepsize);

simulateKeyPress('a');
if (pressA()) {
    console.log("The 'A' key was pressed.");
    multiplyByThree();  // Apply the function based on the predicate
}

simulateKeyPress('b');
if (pressB()) {
    console.log("The 'B' key was pressed.");
    // Additional logic for 'B' key can be added here
}

simulateKeyPress('c');
if (pressC()) {
    console.log("The 'C' key was pressed.");
    // Additional logic for 'C' key can be added here
}
```

### Notes:
- The function `multiplyByThree()` modifies the global variable `stepsize`.
- The predicates `pressA()`, `pressB()`, and `pressC()` check the state of `eventState`, which simulates the state of key presses.
- The `simulateKeyPress(key)` function is a helper to simulate key presses for testing.
- This example uses console logs to demonstrate the flow and results of operations. In a real-world application, you might update a user interface or trigger other side effects.

This basic setup should be adaptable to fit into event-driven environments such as web pages where actual keyboard events can be handled using `addEventListener` for keypress events.
