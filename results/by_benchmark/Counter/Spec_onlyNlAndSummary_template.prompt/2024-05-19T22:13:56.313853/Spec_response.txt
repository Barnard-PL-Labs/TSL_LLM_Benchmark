Based on the description provided, here is how the TSL specification could be structured:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensuring mutual exclusivity of button presses
  !(pressA && pressB);
  !(pressA && pressC);
  !(pressB && pressC);
}

always guarantee {
  // Increment the counter by the current step size when A is pressed
  pressA -> [count <- count + stepsize];

  // Increment the counter by 2 when B is pressed
  pressB -> [count <- count + 2];

  // Increment the counter by 3 when C is pressed
  pressC -> [count <- count + 3];

  // Handling the step size change after pressing A three times in succession
  (pressA && X(pressA && X(pressA && X(pressA)))) -> [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)];

  // Reset the step size to 1 if B or C is pressed
  (pressB || pressC) -> [stepsize <- 1];
}
```

Explanation:
- **Mutual Exclusivity**: This ensures that no two button operations are performed at the same time.
- **Incrementing Count**: The counter is incremented by the `stepsize` when `A` is pressed, by `2` when `B` is pressed, and by `3` when `C` is pressed.
- **Step Size Change**: If the `A` button is pressed four times consecutively, the `stepsize` is increased threefold. This is implemented using nested `X` (next) operators to detect the sequence.
- **Reset Step Size**: If either `B` or `C` is pressed, the `stepsize` is reset to `1`. This helps in managing the dynamic change in increment value when `A` is repeatedly pressed.
