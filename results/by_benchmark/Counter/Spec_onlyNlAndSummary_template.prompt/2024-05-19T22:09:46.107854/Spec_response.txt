Here is how the TSL specification based on your description can be structured:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Assume that no two button presses can occur simultaneously
  !(pressA && pressB);
  !(pressA && pressC);
  !(pressB && pressC);
}

always guarantee {
  // When pressA is pushed, increment the counter by the current step size
  pressA -> [count <- count + stepsize];

  // When pressB is pushed, increment the counter by 2
  pressB -> [count <- count + 2];

  // When pressC is pushed, increment the counter by 3
  pressC -> [count <- count + 3];

  // When pressA is pushed three times in a row, change the step size to 3 times its current value
  (X(pressA) && X(X(pressA)) && X(X(X(pressA)))) -> [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)];

  // When pressB or pressC is pushed, reset the step size to 1
  (pressB || pressC) -> [stepsize <- 1];
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Assumptions**:
   - Mutual exclusion is used to ensure that no two button presses (A, B, or C) can occur at the same time.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - `pressA` triggers an increment of the counter by the current value of `stepsize`.
   - `pressB` always increments the counter by 2.
   - `pressC` always increments the counter by 3.
   - If `pressA` is detected three times in a row, on the following detection of `pressA`, the `stepsize` is multiplied by three. Note: This requires a mechanism to count consecutive `pressA` events, which might need further refinement in the actual implementation to ensure correct behavior.
   - Any press of `pressB` or `pressC` resets the `stepsize` to 1.

This TSL template describes the system behavior based on button presses and how they impact a counter's increment logic. This template assumes that the functions `multiplyByThree()` correctly adjust the `stepsize` and that the initial `stepsize` is set to 1.
