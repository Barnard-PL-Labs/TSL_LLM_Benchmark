Here's how you can translate the given natural language description into a TSL specification:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Assumption that no two buttons are pressed simultaneously
  !(pressA && pressB) && !(pressA && pressC) && !(pressB && pressC);
}

always guarantee {
  // When A is pressed, increment counter by stepsize
  pressA -> [count <- count + stepsize];

  // When B is pressed, increment counter by 2 and reset stepsize to 1
  pressB -> ([count <- count + 2] && [stepsize <- 1]);

  // When C is pressed, increment counter by 3 and reset stepsize to 1
  pressC -> ([count <- count + 3] && [stepsize <- 1]);

  // If A is pressed three times consecutively, on the fourth press, multiply stepsize by 3
  G(pressA && X(pressA) && X(X(pressA)) && X(X(X(pressA))))
    -> [stepsize <- stepsize * 3];

  // Reset stepsize to 1 if either B or C is pressed
  (pressB || pressC) -> [stepsize <- 1];
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Assumptions**: We ensure mutual exclusivity between button presses, meaning no two buttons can be pressed at the same time.
- **Guarantees**:
  - The counter is incremented by `stepsize` when the A key is pressed.
  - The counter increases by 2 for the B key and resets `stepsize` to 1.
  - The counter increases by 3 for the C key and resets `stepsize` to 1 as well.
  - An additional rule is set for the A key: if pressed three times consecutively, the increment size (`stepsize`) is multiplied by 3 on the subsequent press. This rule uses the temporal operator `G` (globally) to handle the sequence of A key presses.
  - Both the B and C key presses reset the `stepsize` to 1, irrespective of the previous state.

This TSL specification captures the entire functionality described in the natural language specification regarding button press operations and their effects on the counter and `stepsize`.
