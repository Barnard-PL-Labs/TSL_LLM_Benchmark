To implement the requested predicates without using any specific wrapper API or JavaScript functions, we need to rely on Temporal Stream Logic (TSL) constructs. TSL predicates are defined based on the inputs which should be described in the TSL environment. For this exercise, we will define both "total" and "e" as inputs and create predicates to analyze their states.

Here's how you would define the TSL template that encapsulates the logic for each predicate:

```plaintext
always assume {
    // Assume the values for 'total' and 'e' are provided by the environment
}

always guarantee {
    // Implement the predicates based on 'total' and 'e'

    // Predicates related to the 'total' cell
    isLessThanPoint75(total) == (total < 0.75);
    isLessThanOne(total) == (total < 1.0);
    isLessThanOnePoint25(total) == (total < 1.25);

    // Predicates related to the 'e' cell which represents events, assuming 'e' holds a character or similar identifier for key presses
    pressD(e) == (e == 'D');
    pressQ(e) == (e == 'Q');
    pressO(e) == (e == 'O');
    press1(e) == (e == '1');
    press2(e) == (e == '2');
    press3(e) == (e == '3');
    pressR(e) == (e == 'R');
}
```

### Explanation
1. **`always assume` Block**: This is where you would normally define the relationships or ongoing states that the environment provides, such as readings from sensors or user inputs. Here, we simply acknowledge that 'total' and 'e' are provided.

2. **`always guarantee` Block**: This section asserts the rules that must always be true based on the environment inputs. Each predicate is a simple comparative or equality check:
   - **For `total`**: We compare the value of `total` to various thresholds (0.75, 1.0, and 1.25).
   - **For `e`**: We check if the value of `e` matches specific characters, which represent key presses.

### Key Points
- **Predicate Definitions**: Each predicate corresponds to a logical condition that is evaluated based on the variables provided by the environment.
- **Character Equality for `e`**: The predicates for key presses assume that `e` contains a character or a similar identifier that can be checked against specific values.

This TSL setup ensures that the system behaves correctly in response to the values of 'total' and the key presses represented by 'e'. It abstracts the direct implementation in JavaScript, focusing instead on the logical specification of the system's behavior over time.
