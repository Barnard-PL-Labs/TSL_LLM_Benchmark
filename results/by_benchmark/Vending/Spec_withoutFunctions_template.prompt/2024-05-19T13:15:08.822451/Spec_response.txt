This TSL specification ensures that button presses on a vending machine are mutually exclusive and that the appropriate total value is updated depending on the button pressed and the current value of `total`. Note that the conditions for decrementing the total are based on predicates that check if the total is greater than or equal to the cost of the product, ensuring that a purchase can only occur if there's enough money in the machine.
