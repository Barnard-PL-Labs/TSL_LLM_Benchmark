To create a TSL template for the vending machine system using the given predicates without implementing JavaScript functions, we can define the predicates directly within the TSL template. This will help in expressing the behavioral and environmental assumptions, as well as the system's guarantees based on these assumptions.

Here is the TSL template for the vending machine system:

```plaintext
always assume {
    // Assumptions about the state of 'total'
    (total < 0.75 -> isLessThanPoint75(total));
    (total < 1 -> isLessThanOne(total));
    (total < 1.25 -> isLessThanOnePoint25(total));
    
    // Assumptions about the state of 'e'
    (e == 'd' -> pressD(e));
    (e == 'q' -> pressQ(e));
    (e == 'o' -> pressO(e));
    (e == '1' -> press1(e));
    (e == '2' -> press2(e));
    (e == '3' -> press3(e));
    (e == 'r' -> pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
    // Define system behavior based on the state of 'total' and 'e'
    // This is a place where you specify responses or state changes based on input assumptions.
    // Example:
    //  pressD(e) -> [action <- dispenseDrink()];
    //  isLessThanOne(total) && press1(e) -> [errorSignal <- insufficientFunds()];
}
```

In this template:
- The `always assume` block contains assumptions about the system's environmental inputs using predicates. These predicates are based on the current states of `total` and `e`, which should correspond to the amounts and key presses respectively.
- The `always guarantee` block should define the system's responses to these inputs. However, since no specific actions were defined in the problem statement, this section contains placeholders that should be filled based on actual system requirements.

This template provides a basic structure that can be expanded with actual system logic and guarantees once the system's response requirements are fully specified.
