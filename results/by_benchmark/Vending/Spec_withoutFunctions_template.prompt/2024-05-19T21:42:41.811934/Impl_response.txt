To implement the predicates as specified in the requirements for a vending machine system, we need to define the predicates in Temporal Stream Logic (TSL) as conditions that can be evaluated based on states of the system. Here's how you could formalize the given predicates in TSL:

```tsl
always assume {
    // Definitions of predicates based on the condition of 'total'
    isLessThanPoint75(total) -> (total < 0.75);
    isLessThanOne(total) -> (total < 1.00);
    isLessThanOnePoint25(total) -> (total < 1.25);

    // Definitions of predicates based on the value of 'e' (key press events)
    pressD(e) -> (e == 'd');
    pressQ(e) -> (e == 'q');
    pressO(e) -> (e == 'o');
    press1(e) -> (e == '1');
    press2(e) -> (e == '2');
    press3(e) -> (e == '3');
    pressR(e) -> (e == 'r');
}

always guarantee {
    // Here you would define system guarantees based on the predicates defined
}
```

### Key elements in the TSL representation:
1. **`always assume { ... }`**:
   - This block contains assumptions about the environment or the inputs to the system. In this case, it describes the conditions under which each predicate holds true based on the current value of `total` or the event `e`.

2. **`always guarantee { ... }`**:
   - This part would contain the operational guarantees of the system, which reacts based on the predicates defined in the assumption block. It is left blank here as the task's requirement was only to define predicates.

3. **Comparative and equality checks**:
   - For `total` related predicates: We use comparative operators (such as `<`) to determine if `total` is less than a specific amount.
   - For `e` (event) based predicates: We use equality checks (`==`) to see if a specific key was pressed.

This TSL setup ensures that the system's behavior can be defined clearly and reactively based on the state of inputs such as `total` and `e`. The predicates provide a basis for these reactions in a formalized and verifiable manner, suitable for systems requiring rigorous specification like a vending machine control system.
