To implement the specified predicates in the given system environment without any provided API wrapper, we must ensure that these predicates evaluate correctly based on the state of the cells `total` and `e`. The predicates will act as conditions that can be used to drive the behavior of the system (in this case, a vending machine) under certain circumstances. Below is how you can implement these predicates within a TSL (Temporal Stream Logic) framework, which is suited for defining behaviors based on temporal logic conditions.

```plaintext
always assume {
    // Assumptions about the environment signals
}

always guarantee {
    // Predicate Implementation: Check if total is less than specific amounts
    isLessThanPoint75(total) -> total < 0.75;
    isLessThanOne(total) -> total < 1;
    isLessThanOnePoint25(total) -> total < 1.25;

    // Predicate Implementation: Check if specific keys are pressed based on the event e
    pressD(e) -> e == 'D';
    pressQ(e) -> e == 'Q';
    pressO(e) -> e == 'O';
    press1(e) -> e == '1';
    press2(e) -> e == '2';
    press3(e) -> e == '3';
    pressR(e) -> e == 'R';
}
```

### Explanation:
- **total** and **e** are considered cells which store state information about the vending machine operation and key press events, respectively.
- The predicates `isLessThanPoint75(total)`, `isLessThanOne(total)`, and `isLessThanOnePoint25(total)` are implemented to check if the value of `total` is less than `0.75`, `1`, and `1.25` respectively.
- The predicates `pressD(e)`, `pressQ(e)`, `pressO(e)`, `press1(e)`, `press2(e)`, and `press3(e)`, `pressR(e)` are implemented to check if the character corresponding to the key press events matches specific keys.

#### Note:
Given the absence of specific details about the API for checking key events, the implementation assumes a straightforward equality check between the event signal `e` and the expected key identifiers. Adjust these checks based on the actual event handling mechanism of your system, which might involve checking a key code or similar attribute if `e` is an event object.
