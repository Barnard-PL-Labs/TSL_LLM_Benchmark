To implement the predicates using Temporal Stream Logic (TSL), you would write specifications that describe the interaction with the vending machine over time based on the events and conditions of the signals represented by the cells `total` and `e`. Given the predicates that need to be implemented, we will define them in the TSL template focusing on how these predicates are expected to be used within the system environment.

Here's how to define these predicates:

```tsl
always assume {
    // Define how signals from cell 'e' (events) are mutually exclusive
    !(pressD(e) && pressQ(e));
    !(pressD(e) && pressO(e));
    !(pressD(e) && press1(e));
    !(pressD(e) && press2(e));
    !(pressD(e) && press3(e));
    !(pressD(e) && pressR(e));
    !(pressQ(e) && pressO(e));
    !(pressQ(e) && press1(e));
    !(pressQ(e) && press2(e));
    !(pressQ(e) && press3(e));
    !(pressQ(e) && pressR(e));
    !(pressO(e) && press1(e));
    !(pressO(e) && press2(e));
    !(pressO(e) && press3(e));
    !(pressO(e) && pressR(e));
    !(press1(e) && press2(e));
    !(press1(e) && press3(e));
    !(press1(e) && pressR(e));
    !(press2(e) && press3(e));
    !(press2(e) && pressR(e));
    !(press3(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
    // Event based responses
    pressD(e) -> [handleDpress()];
    pressQ(e) -> [handleQpress()];
    pressO(e) -> [handleOpress()];
    press1(e) -> [handle1press()];
    press2(e) -> [handle2press()];
    press3(e) -> [handle3press()];
    pressR(e) -> [handleRpress()];

    // Condition based responses
    isLessThanPoint75(total) -> [handleLessThanPoint75()];
    isLessThanOne(total) -> [handleLessThanOne()];
    isLessThanOnePoint25(total) -> [handleLessThanOnePoint25()];
}

// Predicate Implementations
// Assume total is a variable that represents the total amount in the vending machine
// Assume e is a variable that represents the event occurring at the vending machine interface
predicate isLessThanPoint75(total) {
    return total < 0.75;
}

predicate isLessThanOne(total) {
    return total < 1;
}

predicate isLessThanOnePoint25(total) {
    return total < 1.25;
}

predicate pressD(e) {
    return e == 'd';
}

predicate pressQ(e) {
    return e == 'q';
}

predicate pressO(e) {
    return e == 'o';
}

predicate press1(e) {
    return e == '1';
}

predicate press2(e) {
    return e == '2';
}

predicate press3(e) {
    return e == '3';
}

predicate pressR(e) {
    return e == 'r';
}
```

In this TSL template:
- The `always assume` block defines that all key presses (`D`, `Q`, `O`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `R`) are mutually exclusive, meaning no two keys can be pressed simultaneously.
- The `always guarantee` block specifies the system behavior or action that should occur when certain keys are pressed or when the total amount is less than specified thresholds.
- Predicates are implemented to act as boolean functions to evaluate conditions based on the cell `total` and the event `e`. 

This TSL setup ensures that the system responds correctly to interactions and maintains logical consistency across different states and events.
