Based on the description provided, it seems that you want TSL (Temporal Stream Logic) templates implemented for a vending machine system using predicates and without implementing actual functions in JavaScript. TSL is particularly useful for formalizing the behaviors in reactive systems. We'll assume some typical operations and use the predicates to determine the conditions under which certain actions can happen.

Let's write the TSL templates for the vending machine scenario:

### TSL Template for Vending Machine

```plaintext
always assume {
    // assume mutual exclusivity between key presses
    !(pressD(e) && pressQ(e));
    !(pressD(e) && pressO(e));
    !(pressD(e) && press1(e));
    !(pressD(e) && press2(e));
    !(pressD(e) && press3(e));
    !(pressD(e) && pressR(e));
    !(pressQ(e) && pressO(e));
    !(pressQ(e) && press1(e));
    !(pressQ(e) && press2(e));
    !(pressQ(e) && press3(e));
    !(pressQ(e) && pressR(e));
    !(pressO(e) && press1(e));
    !(pressO(e) && press2(e));
    !(pressO(e) && press3(e));
    !(pressO(e) && pressR(e));
    !(press1(e) && press2(e));
    !(press1(e) && press3(e));
    !(press1(e) && pressR(e));
    !(press2(e) && press3(e));
    !(press2(e) && pressR(e));
    !(press3(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Handle monetary value checks
  isLessThanPoint75(total) -> [state <- "Add more money"];
  isLessThanOne(total) && !isLessThanPoint75(total) -> [state <- "Select cheaper product or add money"];
  isLessThanOnePoint25(total) && !isLessThanOne(total) -> [state <- "Select product or add more for premium choices"];

  // Key press actions
  pressD(e) -> [state <- "Dispensed Product D"];
  pressQ(e) -> [state <- "Dispensed Product Q"];
  pressO(e) -> [state <- "Dispensed Product O"];
  press1(e) -> [state <- "Dispensed Product 1"];
  press2(e) -> [state <- "Dispensed Product 2"];
  press3(e) -> [state <- "Dispensed Product 3"];
  pressR(e) -> [state <- "Refund Initiated"];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions:** This section assumes that no two keys can be pressed simultaneously, ensuring mutual exclusivity among the key presses.
2. **Guarantees:** 
   - **Monetary Checks:** Depending on the amount in the `total` cell, the machine transitions into different states, prompting the user to either add more money or make a selection based on available funds.
   - **Product Dispensing:** If specific keys corresponding to products are pressed (`D`, `Q`, `O`, `1`, `2`, `3`), the state of the machine changes to dispense the selected product. If the `R` key is pressed, the action to initiate a refund is triggered.

This template abstractly defines how the vending machine should react to different inputs based on the predicates provided. In a real-world scenario, this would be part of a larger system model that includes physical interactions and safety checks.
