This TSL specification ensures that the vending machine operates correctly based on user inputs. It includes assumptions for mutual exclusion of button presses, guaranteeing that no two operations happen at the same time, and specifies the actions to be taken when each button is pressed. These actions include incrementing the total when money is inserted, decrementing the total when a purchase is made (provided enough credit exists), and resetting the total to zero on refunds.
