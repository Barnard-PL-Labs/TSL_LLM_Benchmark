To implement the predicates described, you can use the following Temporal Stream-based Logic (TSL) template:

```tsl
always assume {
    // Define the predicates for checking the total value
    isLessThanPoint75(total) <-> (total < 0.75);
    isLessThanOne(total) <-> (total < 1);
    isLessThanOnePoint25(total) <-> (total < 1.25);

    // Define the predicates for key presses
    pressD(e) <-> (e.key == 'D');
    pressQ(e) <-> (e.key == 'Q');
    pressO(e) <-> (e.key == 'O');
    press1(e) <-> (e.key == '1');
    press2(e) <-> (e.key == '2');
    press3(e) <-> (e.key == '3');
    pressR(e) <-> (e.key == 'R');
}

always guarantee {
    // Implement reactions or guarantees based on these predicates if required.
}
```

This TSL template sets up assumptions for the predicates based on the description provided. Each predicate either checks a condition against the `total` value or evaluates a key press event based on the `e.key` value. The `always guarantee` block is left empty as there are no specific reactions or guarantees provided in the description. You can add necessary reactions in this block depending on further requirements or system behavior.
