Given the guidelines and requirements you've described, here is the TSL (Temporal Stream Logic) representation for the predicates involved in the vending machine's operations. These predicates are based on the descriptions provided for cell interactions and key press events. Although the request was for JavaScript implementation, here we'll focus on the TSL framework since functions aren't to be used or implemented in this scenario.

```plaintext
always assume {
    // Predicate to check if the 'total' in the vending machine cells is less than different amounts
    isLessThanPoint75(total) := total < 0.75;
    isLessThanOne(total) := total < 1;
    isLessThanOnePoint25(total) := total < 1.25;

    // Predicates related to key press events on 'e'
    pressD(e) := e == 'd';
    pressQ(e) := e == 'q';
    pressO(e) := e == 'o';
    press1(e) := e == '1';
    press2(e) := e == '2';
    press3(e) := e == '3';
    pressR(e) := e == 'r';
}
always guarantee {
    // Here would be the system's response based on the predicates, but since no functions should be used or implemented, this section is intentionally left to focus purely on predicates.
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Assumptions Block (`always assume { ... }`)**: This includes all the predicates that define certain conditions based on the state of the cells and input events. They check values against fixed conditions like `total < 0.75` or event-specific conditions like `e == 'd'`.

- **Guarantees Block (`always guarantee { ... }`)**: In a complete system, this would define the system's responses or guarantees based on the predicates specified in the assumptions. However, per the instructions, this is left blank as no functions or responses are to be implemented.

This TSL template sets the stage for integrating these predicates into a larger control or monitoring system within the vending machine framework where other components (maybe functions or more complex logic) could react based on these predicates.
