To implement the predicates required for the vending machine using Temporal Stream Logic (TSL), you can describe the predicates specifically to interact with the cell states and signals provided by the vending machine's environment. Hereâ€™s how you can define these predicates in a TSL template to ensure proper logical evaluation within the system environment.

```tsl
always assume {
    // Assuming that 'total' and 'e' are inputs that describe the current state of the vending machine
}

always guarantee {
    // Predicate implementations:

    // Check if 'total' is less than 0.75
    isLessThanPoint75(total) = (total < 0.75);

    // Check if 'total' is less than 1
    isLessThanOne(total) = (total < 1);

    // Check if 'total' is less than 1.25
    isLessThanOnePoint25(total) = (total < 1.25);

    // Predicate to check if the 'd' key is pressed
    pressD(e) = (e == 'd');

    // Predicate to check if the 'q' key is pressed
    pressQ(e) = (e == 'q');

    // Predicate to check if the 'o' key is pressed
    pressO(e) = (e == 'o');

    // Predicate to check if the '1' key is pressed
    press1(e) = (e == '1');

    // Predicate to check if the '2' key is pressed
    press2(e) = (e == '2');

    // Predicate to check if the '3' key is pressed
    press3(e) = (e == '3');

    // Predicate to check if the 'r' key is pressed
    pressR(e) = (e == 'r');
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Predicates for 'total'**:
   - Each predicate like `isLessThanPoint75`, `isLessThanOne`, and `isLessThanOnePoint25` simply checks if the value of the `total` cell meets the specified condition. These predicates are critical for determining the machine's ability to vend items based on the monetary value.
   
2. **Predicates for 'e' (Event)**:
   - Each `pressX(e)` predicate checks if the event `e` matches a specific key input. For example, `pressD(e) = (e == 'd')` checks if the key pressed is 'd'. These predicates are essential for enabling user interactions with the vending machine through different keys for various actions such as selecting items or cancelling operations.

By defining these predicates in a TSL structure, you ensure that the logic governing the vending machine's operations comprehensively considers user inputs and current financial state to perform appropriate actions.
