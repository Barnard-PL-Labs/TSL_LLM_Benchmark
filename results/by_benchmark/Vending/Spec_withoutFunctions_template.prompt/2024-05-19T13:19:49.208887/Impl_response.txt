To represent the predicates using Temporal Stream Logic (TSL) for a vending machine system, we can directly express conditions related to the state of `total` and `e` without needing JavaScript implementations. Instead, we'll describe these predicates within the context of a TSL setup.

Here is how we would define these predicates in a TSL template:

```tsl
always assume {
    // Definitions for the predicates related to the 'total' cell
    (total < 0.75) <-> isLessThanPoint75(total);
    (total < 1) <-> isLessThanOne(total);
    (total < 1.25) <-> isLessThanOnePoint25(total);

    // Definitions for the predicates related to the 'e' cell, assuming 'e' captures keypresses
    (e == 'd') <-> pressD(e);
    (e == 'q') <-> pressQ(e);
    (e == 'o') <-> pressO(e);
    (e == '1') <-> press1(e);
    (e == '2') <-> press2(e);
    (e == '3') <-> press3(e);
    (e == 'r') <-> pressR(e);
}
```

### Explanation:
- This setup assumes the predicates are defined as equivalence (`<->`) to conditions based on the values of `total` and `e`. 
- For the `total` cell, we check if it is less than several specific values (0.75, 1, and 1.25), which represent different thresholds relevant to the vending machine's operations.
- For the `e` cell, which we assume captures keypresses, we compare it directly to certain characters representing keys ('d', 'q', 'o', '1', '2', '3', 'r'). Each function like `pressD(e)` is linked to the condition `(e == 'd')`, meaning it returns true if and only if `e` equals 'd'.
  
This TSL representation allows for the creation of predicates in the system's logic without the need for implementing actual functions in JavaScript or another programming language. These predicates can then be used within other TSL constructs to define rules and behaviors of the vending machine based on the state of inputs.
