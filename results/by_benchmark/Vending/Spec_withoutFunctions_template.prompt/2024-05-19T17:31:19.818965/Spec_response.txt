Here's the TSL specification for the described vending machine operation:

```TSL
always assume {
  !(pressD(e) && pressQ(e));
  !(pressD(e) && pressO(e));
  !(pressD(e) && press1(e));
  !(pressD(e) && press2(e));
  !(pressD(e) && press3(e));
  !(pressD(e) && pressR(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && pressO(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && press1(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && press2(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && press3(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && pressR(e));
  !(pressO(e) && press1(e));
  !(pressO(e) && press2(e));
  !(pressO(e) && press3(e));
  !(pressO(e) && pressR(e));
  !(press1(e) && press2(e));
  !(press1(e) && press3(e));
  !(press1(e) && pressR(e));
  !(press2(e) && press3(e));
  !(press2(e) && pressR(e));
  !(press3(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  pressD(e) -> [total <- total + 0.1];
  pressQ(e) -> [total <- total + 0.25];
  pressO(e) -> [total <- total + 1];
  press1(e) && !isLessThanPoint75(total) -> [total <- total - 0.75];
  press2(e) && !isLessThanOne(total) -> [total <- total - 1];
  press3(e) && !isLessThanOnePoint25(total) -> [total <- total - 1.25];
  pressR(e) -> [total <- 0];
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Assumptions**:
    - Each `!(pressX(e) && pressY(e))` ensures mutual exclusion among button presses. This means that no two buttons can be pressed simultaneously, which aligns with the requirement that no two operations can be performed at the same time.

2. **Guarantees**:
    - Each `pressX(e) -> [total <- total + Y]` handles the incrementing of the total value when coins or bills (represented as dimes, quarters, and dollars) are inserted.
    - Each `pressN(e) && !isLessThanZ(total) -> [total <- total - Z]` handles the purchasing of products. It checks if the total amount in the machine is sufficient for the purchase. If it isn't, no action is taken on the total amount (as per the natural language description, "otherwise nothing happens").
    - `pressR(e) -> [total <- 0]` ensures that when the refund button is pressed, the total amount is reset to zero. 

This TSL specification should effectively control the vending machine according to the given description.
