Below are the implementations of the predicates using JavaScript. Since these predicates utilize the provided environment signals (`total` and `e`), I will provide the JavaScript code that checks these conditions based on signal values.

```javascript
// Predicate implementations:

// Checks if 'total' is less than 0.75
function isLessThanPoint75(total) {
    return total < 0.75;
}

// Checks if 'total' is less than 1
function isLessThanOne(total) {
    return total < 1;
}

// Checks if 'total' is less than 1.25
function isLessThanOnePoint25(total) {
    return total < 1.25;
}

// Checks if the 'd' key was pressed
function pressD(e) {
    return e === 'd';
}

// Checks if the 'q' key was pressed
function pressQ(e) {
    return e === 'q';
}

// Checks if the 'o' key was pressed
function pressO(e) {
    return e === 'o';
}

// Checks if the '1' key was pressed
function press1(e) {
    return e === '1';
}

// Checks if the '2' key was pressed
function press2(e) {
    return e === '2';
}

// Checks if the '3' key was pressed
function press3(e) {
    return e === '3';
}

// Checks if the 'r' key was pressed
function pressR(e) {
    return e === 'r';
}
```

### Usage Example
If you want to use these predicates, you need the values for `total` and `e` which should be provided by the system environment where these functions will be deployed. Here's an example of how you might use one of these predicates:

```javascript
// Example usage:
let total = 0.50; // This would be dynamically provided by the vending machine system
let keyPressed = 'd'; // This would be triggered by a user action

if (isLessThanPoint75(total)) {
    console.log("Total is less than 0.75");
}

if (pressD(keyPressed)) {
    console.log("Key 'd' was pressed");
}
```

Make sure the environment where these functions are deployed properly passes the `total` for monetary values and `e` for keypress events, as these are critical for the logic within the predicates to function correctly.
