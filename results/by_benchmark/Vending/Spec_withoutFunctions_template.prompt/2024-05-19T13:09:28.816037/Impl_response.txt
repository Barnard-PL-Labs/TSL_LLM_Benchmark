When designing the TSL template for the vending machine system based on the given predicates, we will focus on the `always assume` and `always guarantee` sections. However, since no direct JavaScript implementation or function definitions are required, we will outline the predicates and their integration into the TSL framework.

### TSL Template for a Vending Machine

We'll express the predicates in TSL format, assuming that the machine's operation depends on the value of `total` for monetary transactions and `e` for keypress events.

```tsl
always assume {
  // Define the predicates for the total value
  (isLessThanPoint75(total));
  (isLessThanOne(total));
  (isLessThanOnePoint25(total));

  // Define the predicates for keypress events
  (pressD(e));
  (pressQ(e));
  (pressO(e));
  (press1(e));
  (press2(e));
  (press3(e));
  (pressR(e));
}
```

### Explanation of Predicates
These predicates are assumed in the context of the vending machine environment where:
- `isLessThanPoint75(total)` checks if the total amount inserted is less than $0.75.
- `isLessThanOne(total)` checks if the total amount inserted is less than $1.00.
- `isLessThanOnePoint25(total)` checks if the total amount inserted is less than $1.25.
- The predicates `pressD(e)`, `pressQ(e)`, etc., check if specific keys (D, Q, O, 1, 2, 3, R) are pressed.

### Guarantee Section
For the `always guarantee` section, we would define how the system should react based on these predicates. However, specific responses or operations are not specified in your description, so a generic structure is mentioned.

```tsl
always guarantee {
  // Response actions based on key presses or total value checks
  // These would typically include conditions to dispense items, return change, etc.
  // Example (generic and to be defined):
  pressD(e) -> [action <- dispenseDrink];
  isLessThanPoint75(total) -> [action <- displayMessage("Insufficient Amount")];
}
```

### Integration and Usage
This TSL template serves as a framework to guide the vending machine's operational logic. Each predicate informs a specific aspect of the operations (like checking amounts or key presses), and corresponding actions would be defined based on what the machine should do under those conditions (e.g., dispense items, show messages).

This template ensures that the system's behavior is formally specified and aligns with the requirements set by the predicates, facilitating predictable and consistent operations.
