To create TSL templates based on the given predicates without implementing any functions, you can define how these predicates shape the behavior of the system in a reactive model. Below, I'll provide a conceptual translation of these predicates into TSL format under the `always assume` and `always guarantee` sections, as appropriate. Since we are not implementing actual functions but defining behavior, the TSL will reflect conditions and responses conceptually.

### TSL Template for the Vending Machine System

```tsl
always assume {
    // Assuming the environment provides these signals correctly
    (total < 0.75) <-> isLessThanPoint75(total);
    (total < 1) <-> isLessThanOne(total);
    (total < 1.25) <-> isLessThanOnePoint25(total);
    (e.key == 'd') <-> pressD(e);
    (e.key == 'q') <-> pressQ(e);
    (e.key == 'o') <-> pressO(e);
    (e.key == '1') <-> press1(e);
    (e.key == '2') <-> press2(e);
    (e.key == '3') <-> press3(e);
    (e.key == 'r') <-> pressR(e);
}

always guarantee {
    // Define system behaviors based on predicates
    // You can specify operations or transitions that the system should make
    // when these predicates are true. For example:

    // If total is less than 0.75, some operations can be disabled
    isLessThanPoint75(total) -> [operationEnabled <- false];

    // When key 'd' is pressed, execute some function or update
    pressD(e) -> [performOperationD <- true];

    // Reset or update states when specific keys are pressed
    pressQ(e) -> [resetMachine <- true];
    pressO(e) -> [openSettings <- true];
    press1(e) || press2(e) || press3(e) -> [selectOption <- true];
    pressR(e) -> [reloadResources <- true];
}
```

### Notes:
- The `always assume` block is used to describe the environment's input behavior, how the predicates are related to the actual signals from the system (like total amount in the vending machine or key presses).
  
- The `always guarantee` block describes how the machine should react to these inputs. Actions like enabling/disabling operations, performing specific tasks when keys are pressed, etc., are defined here.

- This template does not include specifics of the actions (`performOperationD`, `resetMachine`, etc.) since it's conceptual. You would replace these with actual system commands or updates as per the real system's API or capabilities. 

This TSL template aims to help you structure the reactive behavior of your vending machine system based on the predicates you've defined. Adjustments may be necessary depending on further details of your system's capabilities and requirements.
