To implement the predicates using JavaScript, we will write functions that evaluate the conditions stated. These functions will take parameters as described in the predicates list provided. Since we're not implementing any of the system API functions directly, we'll assume that the data (`total` and `e`) are passed as parameters to these predicates. Hereâ€™s how you can implement these predicates:

```javascript
// Predicate to check if total is less than 0.75
function isLessThanPoint75(total) {
    return total < 0.75;
}

// Predicate to check if total is less than 1
function isLessThanOne(total) {
    return total < 1;
}

// Predicate to check if total is less than 1.25
function isLessThanOnePoint25(total) {
    return total < 1.25;
}

// Predicate to check if the 'd' key was pressed
function pressD(e) {
    return e.key === 'd';
}

// Predicate to check if the 'q' key was pressed
function pressQ(e) {
    return e.key === 'q';
}

// Predicate to check if the 'o' key was pressed
function pressO(e) {
    return e.key === 'o';
}

// Predicate to check if the '1' key was pressed
function press1(e) {
    return e.key === '1';
}

// Predicate to check if the '2' key was pressed
function press2(e) {
    return e.key === '2';
}

// Predicate to check if the '3' key was pressed
function press3(e) {
    return e.key === '3';
}

// Predicate to check if the 'r' key was pressed
function pressR(e) {
    return e.key === 'r';
}
```

### Usage Example

These functions would typically be used in event handlers or other parts of your system where you need to make decisions based on the values of `total` or user keypress events. For example:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('keypress', function(event) {
    if (pressD(event)) {
        console.log("Key 'D' was pressed.");
    }
    if (pressQ(event)) {
        console.log("Key 'Q' was pressed.");
    }
});

let currentTotal = 0.5;
if (isLessThanPoint75(currentTotal)) {
    console.log("Current total is less than 0.75.");
}
```

This example assumes the browser environment for key presses and a simple condition check for the `total`. Adjust the context as necessary depending on how `total` and `e` are updated or passed in your specific application environment.
