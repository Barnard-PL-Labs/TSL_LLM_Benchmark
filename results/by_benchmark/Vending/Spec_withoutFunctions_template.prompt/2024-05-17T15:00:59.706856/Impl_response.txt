Given the API overview and the task criteria, here's how you can implement the specified predicates using Temporal Stream Logic (TSL) within a structured setup. This format doesn't involve JavaScript directly since no functions are to be implemented, but rather predicates that represent states or conditions within the system. This setup presumes an environment where these predicates are evaluated continuously to respond to changes.

```tsl
always assume {
  // Define the range for the 'total' cell to ensure correctness of the predicates
  (total >= 0) ;
}

always guarantee {
  // Predicate to check if 'total' is less than 0.75
  isLessThanPoint75: total < 0.75;
  
  // Predicate to check if 'total' is less than 1
  isLessThanOne: total < 1;
  
  // Predicate to check if 'total' is less than 1.25
  isLessThanOnePoint25: total < 1.25;
  
  // Predicates to check for key presses on 'e' (each key represented by a boolean attribute)
  pressD: e.key == 'd';
  pressQ: e.key == 'q';
  pressO: e.key == 'o';
  press1: e.key == '1';
  press2: e.key == '2';
  press3: e.key == '3';
  pressR: e.key == 'r';
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Assumptions Section**:
   - **Total Range**: Ensures that the `total` variable is never negative, which could potentially break the logic of your predicates if negative values aren't handled by your system logic.

2. **Guarantee Section**:
   - **Numeric Comparisons**: The predicates `isLessThanPoint75`, `isLessThanOne`, and `isLessThanOnePoint25` evaluate whether the `total` is less than the specified values, respectively.
   - **Key Press Checks**: Each `pressX(e)` predicate checks whether a specific key (denoted by 'd', 'q', 'o', '1', '2', '3', 'r') is pressed. The presumption here is that `e.key` represents the last key pressed, which is how you're able to check against specific keys.

This TSL setup is essential for environments where system states need to be continuously evaluated and acted upon. Each predicate becomes a condition that can trigger different actions or states within the system based on its current inputs and ongoing state.
