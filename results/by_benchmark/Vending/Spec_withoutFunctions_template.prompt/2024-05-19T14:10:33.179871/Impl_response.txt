Below are the implementations for the predicates described using Temporal Stream Logic (TSL), assuming each predicate evaluates the condition based on the current state of the system (i.e., each function is a boolean expression that becomes true when its specific condition is met).

```tsl
always assume {
  // Define the predicates as boolean expressions based on the current system state
}

always guarantee {
  // Predicates for checking values of the 'total' cell
  isLessThanPoint75(total) <-> (total < 0.75);
  isLessThanOne(total) <-> (total < 1.0);
  isLessThanOnePoint25(total) <-> (total < 1.25);
  
  // Predicates for button presses based on the 'e' cell's signals
  pressD(e) <-> (e == 'd');
  pressQ(e) <-> (e == 'q');
  pressO(e) <-> (e == 'o');
  press1(e) <-> (e == '1');
  press2(e) <-> (e == '2');
  press3(e) <-> (e == '3');
  pressR(e) <-> (e == 'r');
}
```

In this TSL representation:
- The `always assume` block is used to define the input conditions or assumptions about the environment. Since you mentioned not to implement any functions and not to use the API directly, this block is left with a placeholder comment.
- The `always guarantee` block contains the guarantees, which in this context are the definitions of each predicate. Each predicate checks a specific condition using the variables `total` and `e` that represent the state of the system. For example, `isLessThanPoint75(total)` checks if the value of `total` is less than 0.75.

It is assumed that the values for `total` and `e` are continuously updated by the system, reflecting the state of the vending machine. This model allows the vending machine to react based on these predicates' statuses, which are evaluated as either true or false depending on the current state.
