In a Temporal Stream Logic (TSL) context where the implementation of functions is not required, and our focus is on predicates, we can define how these predicates relate to the system's behavior using the TSL template. Here we'll set up the TSL environment that assumes certain user interactions and guarantees system responses based on the predicates outlined.

```tsl
always assume {
}

always guarantee {
  // Define the behavior for the total amount in the vending machine
  // Check if total is less than various amounts
  isLessThanPoint75(total) -> (total < 0.75);
  isLessThanOne(total) -> (total < 1);
  isLessThanOnePoint25(total) -> (total < 1.25);

  // Define the predicates for button presses
  pressD(e) -> (e.key == 'd');
  pressQ(e) -> (e.key == 'q');
  pressO(e) -> (e.key == 'o');
  press1(e) -> (e.key == '1');
  press2(e) -> (e.key == '2');
  press3(e) -> (e.key == '3');
  pressR(e) -> (e.key == 'r');
}
```

This TSL template simply maps the predicate functions to their logical implementations, assuming that `total` represents the amount of money currently inputted into the vending machine and `e` represents an event containing a key press.

### Explanation:
1. **Predicates for Amounts**: These check if the `total` amount in the vending machine is less than a certain value. For example, `isLessThanPoint75(total)` checks if the total amount is less than $0.75. This is crucial for a vending machine that may have items priced at different thresholds.

2. **Predicates for Key Presses**: These predicates check if specific keys are pressed. This is essential for vending machines where different keys can be mapped to different functionalities or products. For instance, pressing 'd' might dispense a drink, while pressing '1' might add $0.25 to the total.

### Note:
The actual system API functions and their mappings are not implemented here because it's specified not to implement any functions. This TSL setup assumes the actions (like checking amounts or detecting key presses) are handled elsewhere in the system, and here we are only defining the logical relations in a TSL context.
