For this task, we need to implement various predicates in TSL that utilize the conditions provided. These predicates must evaluate to either true or false based on the current state of provided signals `total` and `e`. Here's how you can define these predicates using TSL (Temporal Stream Logic):

```tsl
always assume {
    // Define the meaning of the predicates based on the state of `total` and `e` cells.
    isLessThanPoint75(total) := total < 0.75;
    isLessThanOne(total) := total < 1.00;
    isLessThanOnePoint25(total) := total < 1.25;
    pressD(e) := e == 'd';
    pressQ(e) := e == 'q';
    pressO(e) := e == 'o';
    press1(e) := e == '1';
    press2(e) := e == '2';
    press3(e) := e == '3';
    pressR(e) := e == 'r';
}

always guarantee {
    // The predicates themselves do not dictate system behavior directly, but rather are used
    // to trigger or condition responses in system behavior rules.
    // No direct system guarantees are defined here, as no behavior is specified in the task.
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Predicates** as defined are used to check conditions based on the inputs from 'total' and 'e'. Each predicate functionally represents a simple boolean check.
- **`isLessThanPoint75`, `isLessThanOne`, `isLessThanOnePoint25`** check if the value of `total` is less than the specified thresholds.
- **`pressD`, `pressQ`, `pressO`, `press1`, `press2`, `press3`, `pressR`** check if the value of `e` matches the respective characters, indicating that a key has been pressed.

These predicates can be used in system guarantees to control how the system behaves based on the value of `total` or which key is pressed in `e`. For example, in a vending machine scenario, different buttons might trigger the dispensing of different products, or require different amounts in `total` before allowing an operation.
