To translate the described predicates into a TSL (Temporal Stream Logic) format within an environment for a vending machine system using the API provided, we need to express these predicates in the `always assume` section of the TSL template. However, since you specified not to use and implement any functions, we'll purely focus on the predicates with logical and temporal expressions.

Hereâ€™s a proposed TSL setup:

```tsl
always assume {
    // Definitions of predicates based on the state of 'total' and 'e'
    isLessThanPoint75(total) -> total < 0.75;
    isLessThanOne(total) -> total < 1;
    isLessThanOnePoint25(total) -> total < 1.25;
    
    pressD(e) -> (e == 'd');
    pressQ(e) -> (e == 'q');
    pressO(e) -> (e == 'o');
    press1(e) -> (e == '1');
    press2(e) -> (e == '2');
    press3(e) -> (e == '3');
    pressR(e) -> (e == 'r');
}

always guarantee {
    // Define the reactions of the vending machine based on the predicates.
    // Placeholders for reactions; should be filled with appropriate system responses or actions.
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Predicates related to `total`:**
   - `isLessThanPoint75(total)`, `isLessThanOne(total)`, and `isLessThanOnePoint25(total)` are defined based on whether the `total` is less than 0.75, 1, and 1.25 respectively.

2. **Predicates related to `e`:**
   - `pressD(e)`, `pressQ(e)`, `pressO(e)`, `press1(e)`, `press2(e)`, `press3(e)`, `pressR(e)` check if the specific keys ('d', 'q', 'o', '1', '2', '3', 'r') are pressed. They are compared against the current signal state `e`.

### Note:
- The `always guarantee` block is kept empty as the implementation of the system's response to these predicates is not provided or requested. In a full implementation, this block would contain the system's reactions to the various predicates, possibly involving control actions like dispensing products, providing feedback to the user, or handling payments based on the predicates defined in the `always assume` block.

This setup ensures that the system continuously monitors the conditions based on the cell states and reacts accordingly, although the specific actions are to be defined based on system requirements.
