To implement the predicates using a hypothetical API in JavaScript, we'll define each predicate as a function. Since the functions can't be implemented without the actual API, I will provide the structure based on the descriptions given:

```javascript
// Predicates to check the value of 'total' cell

/**
 * Checks if the total is less than 0.75.
 * @param {number} total - The current total amount.
 * @returns {boolean}
 */
function isLessThanPoint75(total) {
    return total < 0.75;
}

/**
 * Checks if the total is less than 1.
 * @param {number} total - The current total amount.
 * @returns {boolean}
 */
function isLessThanOne(total) {
    return total < 1;
}

/**
 * Checks if the total is less than 1.25.
 * @param {number} total - The current total amount.
 * @returns {boolean}
 */
function isLessThanOnePoint25(total) {
    return total < 1.25;
}

// Predicates to check the keypress events from 'e' cell

/**
 * Checks if the 'd' key was pressed.
 * @param {object} e - The event object containing key states.
 * @returns {boolean}
 */
function pressD(e) {
    return e.key === 'd';
}

/**
 * Checks if the 'q' key was pressed.
 * @param {object} e - The event object containing key states.
 * @returns {boolean}
 */
function pressQ(e) {
    return e.key === 'q';
}

/**
 * Checks if the 'o' key was pressed.
 * @param {object} e - The event object containing key states.
 * @returns {boolean}
 */
function pressO(e) {
    return e.key === 'o';
}

/**
 * Checks if the '1' key was pressed.
 * @param {object} e - The event object containing key states.
 * @returns {boolean}
 */
function press1(e) {
    return e.key === '1';
}

/**
 * Checks if the '2' key was pressed.
 * @param {object} e - The event object containing key states.
 * @returns {boolean}
 */
function press2(e) {
    return e.key === '2';
}

/**
 * Checks if the '3' key was pressed.
 * @param {object} e - The event object containing key states.
 * @returns {boolean}
 */
function press3(e) {
    return e.key === '3';
}

/**
 * Checks if the 'r' key was pressed.
 * @param {object} e - The event object containing key states.
 * @returns {boolean}
 */
function pressR(e) {
    return e.key === 'r';
}
```

This structure assumes that `e` is an event object similar to what would be found in a standard JavaScript key event, with the `key` property representing the character of the key pressed. The `total` parameter in the first set of functions is presumed to be a numeric value that represents some accumulated total, like money inserted into a vending machine. Each function evaluates a simple condition and returns a boolean indicating whether the condition is met.
