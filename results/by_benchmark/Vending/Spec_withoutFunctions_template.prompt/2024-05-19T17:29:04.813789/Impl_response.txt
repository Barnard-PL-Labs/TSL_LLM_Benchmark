Here's the TSL template describing the predicates for the vending machine scenario, based on the description provided. This template utilizes the predicates to interact with the environment and control the system's behavior accordingly in a hypothetical vending machine system.

```tsl
always assume {
    // Assume these predicates are provided by the environment with the given total and e signals
    isLessThanPoint75(total);
    isLessThanOne(total);
    isLessThanOnePoint25(total);
    pressD(e);
    pressQ(e);
    pressO(e);
    press1(e);
    press2(e);
    press3(e);
    pressR(e);
}

always guarantee {
    // Define system guarantees based on input predicates

    // If total is less than 0.75 and 'D' is pressed, perform some action
    (isLessThanPoint75(total) && pressD(e)) -> [action <- performActionA()];

    // If total is less than 1 and 'Q' is pressed, perform some action
    (isLessThanOne(total) && pressQ(e)) -> [action <- performActionB()];

    // If total is less than 1.25 and 'O' is pressed, perform some action
    (isLessThanOnePoint25(total) && pressO(e)) -> [action <- performActionC()];

    // Different actions based on number keys pressed under certain conditions
    (press1(e)) -> [action <- performAction1()];
    (press2(e)) -> [action <- performAction2()];
    (press3(e)) -> [action <- performAction3()];

    // If 'R' is pressed, reset or perform a specific reset action
    pressR(e) -> [action <- resetAll()];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions**: The predicates such as `isLessThanPoint75(total)` or `pressD(e)` are considered to be provided by the environment. These predicates reflect the state of the vending machine and user inputs respectively.

2. **Guarantees**: The system's reactions are defined under the `always guarantee` section. Based on the combination of predicates (`total` value and button press), the system executes specific actions. For example:
   - If the total amount inserted is less than $0.75 and the 'D' button is pressed, the system will perform `performActionA()`.
   - The use of predicates like `press1(e)` directly triggers actions such as `performAction1()` without additional conditions, presuming these are unconditional responses to the specific button presses.

This TSL template abstracts the decision-making logic of a vending machine in response to user inputs and internal state conditions. The actions like `performActionA()`, `resetAll()`, etc., are placeholders for actual system calls or methods that would be implemented in the system's control software.
