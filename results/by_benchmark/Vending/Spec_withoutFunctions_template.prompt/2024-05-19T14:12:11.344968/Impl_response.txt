To express the predicates in TSL for the vending machine scenario described, we will define the respective signals and conditions that evaluate the total amount against various thresholds and the detection of specific key presses from the input `e`. Let's write the TSL `always assume` and `always guarantee` blocks, ensuring that we capture the predicates correctly.

We start by defining the predicates for the `total` and the key presses in `e`:

```tsl
always assume {
}

always guarantee {
    // Predicates on the 'total' cell, evaluating different monetary conditions
    // These predicates check if the total amount in the vending machine is below certain thresholds
    isLessThanPoint75(total) -> (total < 0.75);
    isLessThanOne(total) -> (total < 1.00);
    isLessThanOnePoint25(total) -> (total < 1.25);

    // Predicates on the 'e' cell, checking for specific key presses
    // These check if specific keys are pressed, where 'e' holds the current key press state
    pressD(e) -> (e == 'd');
    pressQ(e) -> (e == 'q');
    pressO(e) -> (e == 'o');
    press1(e) -> (e == '1');
    press2(e) -> (e == '2');
    press3(e) -> (e == '3');
    pressR(e) -> (e == 'r');
}
```

In this implementation:

1. **Predicates on `total`**:
    - We define predicates that evaluate whether the total amount in the machine is less than the specified thresholds (0.75, 1.00, and 1.25). These conditions are useful for determining the affordability of items or the need to alert for additional money.

2. **Predicates on `e` (event input)**:
    - These predicates check if a particular key has been pressed. Each key (e.g., 'd', 'q', 'o', '1', '2', '3', 'r') represents a potential user input in the vending machine interface, possibly used for selecting items or triggering actions.

This TSL setup allows for defining a clear interface for handling and reacting to changes in a vending machine system in a structured and formalized manner, using Temporal Stream Logic to model the behavior over time.
