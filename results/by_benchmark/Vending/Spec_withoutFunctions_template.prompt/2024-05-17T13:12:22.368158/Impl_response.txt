To implement the predicates as specified, you can use the Temporal Stream Language (TSL) format. Here's how you might define each predicate using TSL in the context of a vending machine system. These predicates will check the specified conditions based on the system's inputs (`total` and `e`).

```tsl
always assume {
  // Define the input cell `total` which represents the state of the signal for monetary total
  (total);

  // Define the input cell `e` which represents the event or action taken (e.g., key pressed)
  (e);
}

always guarantee {
  // Predicate to check if total less than $0.75
  isLessThanPoint75(total) -> (total < 0.75);

  // Predicate to check if total less than $1
  isLessThanOne(total) -> (total < 1);

  // Predicate to check if total less than $1.25
  isLessThanOnePoint25(total) -> (total < 1.25);

  // Predicates for key presses based on the event 'e'
  pressD(e) -> (e == 'd');  // User pressed the 'd' key
  pressQ(e) -> (e == 'q');  // User pressed the 'q' key
  pressO(e) -> (e == 'o');  // User pressed the 'o' key
  press1(e) -> (e == '1');  // User pressed the '1' key
  press2(e) -> (e == '2');  // User pressed the '2' key
  press3(e) -> (e == '3');  // User pressed the '3' key
  pressR(e) -> (e == 'r');  // User pressed the 'r' key
}
```

### Explanation:
- `always assume` is used to define the inputs or assumptions about the system environment.
- `always guarantee` is where the logic of how the system should react to these inputs is specified.
- Each predicate function (`isLessThanPoint75`, `isLessThanOne`, etc.) is defined using the `->` operator, which in the context of TSL is used to map inputs to their corresponding outputs or states.
- The comparison inside the predicates (e.g., `total < 0.75`) directly translates the logic of whether the value in `total` is less than the specified amount.
- The key press checks (e.g., `pressD(e) -> (e == 'd')`) map the event `e` to a boolean indicating whether a specific key was pressed. 

This implementation relies on the naming and structure of TSL, making it suitable for environments where the state and actions can be defined as simple expressions evaluated over time. If you need actual JavaScript functions for these predicates, you would normally define them in a manner that they return boolean values based on inputs, but since here we are working within a TSL context, JavaScript functions are not used.
