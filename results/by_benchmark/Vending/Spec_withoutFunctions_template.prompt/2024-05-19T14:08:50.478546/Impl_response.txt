Here is the implementation of the predicates specified using TSL (Temporal Stream Logic) for a vending machine system environment. This implementation assumes that the API provides some mechanism to track the current total amount within the vending machine (`total`) and the key pressed by the user (`e`).

```tsl
always assume {
    // Define the conditions for the different monetary limits
    isLessThanPoint75(total) <-> total < 0.75;
    isLessThanOne(total) <-> total < 1.0;
    isLessThanOnePoint25(total) <-> total < 1.25;

    // Define the conditions for key presses
    pressD(e) <-> e == 'd';
    pressQ(e) <-> e == 'q';
    pressO(e) <-> e == 'o';
    press1(e) <-> e == '1';
    press2(e) <-> e == '2';
    press3(e) <-> e == '3';
    pressR(e) <-> e == 'r';
}
```

### Key Points:

1. **Cells and Predicates**: In TSL, we represent system states and conditions using predicates. For example, `isLessThanPoint75(total)` checks if the `total` cell's value is less than 0.75. This follows for other monetary predicates.

2. **Key Press Detection**: Each key press detection predicate like `pressD(e)` checks if the event `e` is equal to a specific key identifier, indicating that the key has been pressed.

3. **System Environment Integration**: Ensure that the actual implementation environment correctly updates `total` and `e` based on the system's operations and user interactions. This TSL setup assumes that these values are updated elsewhere in the system, and here we only define the logical conditions.

### Usage:

This TSL configuration is meant to be part of a larger system definition which includes assumptions about the environment (inputs such as `total` and `e`) and guarantees based on these assumptions (actions of the vending machine). Implementing the system using this logical framework helps in specifying and verifying the behavior of the vending machine in different scenarios.
