To implement the predicates described using Temporal Stream Logic (TSL), and assuming an abstract representation of the vending machine system, the TSL structure would look something like this:

```tsl
always assume {
    // Assumptions about the inputs (states of signals 'total' and 'e')
}

always guarantee {
    // Guarantees based on the predicates defined
}

// Predicates based on the 'total' cell
isLessThanPoint75(total) -> (total < 0.75);
isLessThanOne(total) -> (total < 1.00);
isLessThanOnePoint25(total) -> (total < 1.25);

// Predicates based on the 'e' cell for different key presses
pressD(e) -> (e == 'd'); // Assuming 'e' holds the last key pressed
pressQ(e) -> (e == 'q');
pressO(e) -> (e == 'o');
press1(e) -> (e == '1');
press2(e) -> (e == '2');
press3(e) -> (e == '3');
pressR(e) -> (e == 'r');
```

This TSL structure sets up a framework where the system's behavior is outlined based on the state of the inputs, 'total' and 'e'. Each predicate function checks the condition and returns a boolean value. The `always assume` block is where the input conditions are specified, and `always guarantee` is where the system's response based on these conditions is defined. Here, we only provide the predicates without any specific guarantees or assumptions about how the input states are managed or change over time, as this would depend on further details about the vending machine's operational logic and environment.
