Here is the TSL specification based on the natural language description provided:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Mutual exclusion for button presses; only one can be pressed at a time
  !(pressD(e) && pressQ(e));
  !(pressD(e) && pressO(e));
  !(pressD(e) && press1(e));
  !(pressD(e) && press2(e));
  !(pressD(e) && press3(e));
  !(pressD(e) && pressR(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && pressO(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && press1(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && press2(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && press3(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && pressR(e));
  !(pressO(e) && press1(e));
  !(pressO(e) && press2(e));
  !(pressO(e) && press3(e));
  !(pressO(e) && pressR(e));
  !(press1(e) && press2(e));
  !(press1(e) && press3(e));
  !(press1(e) && pressR(e));
  !(press2(e) && press3(e));
  !(press2(e) && pressR(e));
  !(press3(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Incrementing the total when d, q or o are pressed
  pressD(e) -> [total <- total + 0.1];
  pressQ(e) -> [total <- total + 0.25];
  pressO(e) -> [total <- total + 1];

  // Decrementing the total for product purchases if conditions are met
  press1(e) && isLessThanPoint75(total) -> [total <- total - 0.75];
  press2(e) && isLessThanOne(total) -> [total <- total - 1];
  press3(e) && isLessThanOnePoint25(total) -> [total <- total - 1.25];

  // Resetting the total when r is pressed
  pressR(e) -> [total <- 0];
}
```

### Key Points and Assumptions
- **Mutual Exclusion of Button Presses**: Ensuring that no two machine operations (button presses) can be performed at the same time. This is crucial for preventing simultaneous operations that could lead to incorrect or unexpected behavior.
- **Operations on the Machine's Total**: Depending on the button pressed, different operations are performed on the machine's total value. The operations include incrementing the total by fixed amounts (dime, quarter, or dollar) based on the respective button presses or decrementing the total by the cost of the product, provided sufficient credit exists in the machine.
- **Resetting the Total**: When the refund button (pressR) is pressed, the total is reset to zero.
- **Conditional Operations**: Some operations (like purchasing products) have conditions based on the current total value in the machine. These conditions are checked before the operations are performed.

This TSL specification encapsulates the behavior of a vending machine based on user inputs and maintains the integrity of operations through mutual exclusion and condition checks.
