To implement the predicates specified using TSL (Temporal Stream Logic) for a vending machine system, we can define the predicates in the `always assume` block of the TSL template. Each predicate checks a specific condition related to the input signals `total` and `e`. These predicates do not directly contain JavaScript functions but rather are defined using logical expressions in TSL for clarity and simplicity.

Here is how you can define these predicates in a TSL context:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Predicates to check various conditions on the 'total' cell
  isLessThanPoint75(total) <-> (total < 0.75);
  isLessThanOne(total) <-> (total < 1);
  isLessThanOnePoint25(total) <-> (total < 1.25);

  // Predicates to check various key presses on the 'e' cell
  pressD(e) <-> (e == 'd');
  pressQ(e) <-> (e == 'q');
  pressO(e) <-> (e == 'o');
  press1(e) <-> (e == '1');
  press2(e) <-> (e == '2');
  press3(e) <-> (e == '3');
  pressR(e) <-> (e == 'r');
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Predicates for `total`:**
   - `isLessThanPoint75(total)`: Returns `true` if the `total` is less than 0.75.
   - `isLessThanOne(total)`: Returns `true` if the `total` is less than 1.
   - `isLessThanOnePoint25(total)`: Returns `true` if the `total` is less than 1.25.

2. **Predicates for `e`:**
   - `pressD(e)`: Returns `true` if the key 'd' is pressed.
   - `pressQ(e)`: Returns `true` if the key 'q' is pressed.
   - `pressO(e)`: Returns `true` if the key 'o' is pressed.
   - `press1(e)`: Returns `true` if the key '1' is pressed.
   - `press2(e)`: Returns `true` if the key '2' is pressed.
   - `press3(e)`: Returns `true` if the key '3' is pressed.
   - `pressR(e)`: Returns `true` if the key 'r' is pressed.

### TSL Setup:

In a TSL system, we use the `always assume` block to define conditions that are always assumed to be true based on the inputs. The predicates defined here are used to interpret the signals from the vending machine environment. These predicates can then be employed in the `always guarantee` block to specify how the system should behave based on these conditions. For instance, you could define actions to be taken when certain keys are pressed or when the total amount meets certain criteria (like enabling a purchase button in the vending machine).
