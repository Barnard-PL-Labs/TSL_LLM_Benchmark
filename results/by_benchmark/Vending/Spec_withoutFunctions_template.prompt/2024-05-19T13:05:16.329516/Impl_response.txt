In the described scenario, we need to write predicates in Temporal Stream Logic (TSL) that utilize the system environment API to determine various conditions based on the inputs provided (`total` and `e`). Since these predicates are meant to inform the behavior of a system (like a vending machine), they should be defined within the logic that governs how the system should react to inputs. Here, I will assume these predicates are part of a larger TSL specification for a vending machine system.

Below is an example of how these predicates can be incorporated into a TSL framework:

```tsl
always assume {
    // Here we define the assumptions about the environment or inputs
}

always guarantee {
    // Using predicates to define system behavior based on the `total` and `e` inputs

    // Define the predicates to check amounts against `total`
    isLessThanPoint75(total) <=> total < 0.75;
    isLessThanOne(total) <=> total < 1;
    isLessThanOnePoint25(total) <=> total < 1.25;

    // Define the predicates to check key presses from `e`
    pressD(e) <=> e == 'd';
    pressQ(e) <=> e == 'q';
    pressO(e) <=> e == 'o';
    press1(e) <=> e == '1';
    press2(e) <=> e == '2';
    press3(e) <=> e == '3';
    pressR(e) <=> e == 'r';

    // Define system responses or further logic based on these predicates
    // Examples:
    // If the 'd' key is pressed, do something
    pressD(e) -> [action <- performSomeAction()];

    // If the total is less than $0.75, trigger a specific response
    isLessThanPoint75(total) -> [response <- notifyUnderThreshold()];
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Assume Section**: This is where we define what we assume about the environment or the input. This might include constraints or mutual exclusivity between inputs.
  
- **Guarantee Section**: Contains the logic that uses the predicates. Each predicate translates a condition from the system API into a TSL expression.
  - `total < X` and `e == 'key'` check the conditions based on the inputs. These are used within the predicates to determine true or false values.
  - `->` is used for implications in the logic, specifying what should happen if a predicate holds true.

### Note:
1. The actual implementation of actions like `[action <- performSomeAction()]` and `[response <- notifyUnderThreshold()]` would depend on the specific methods or procedures defined elsewhere in the system that handle these actions.
2. This example assumes a simplified form of a TSL-like syntax and might need adjustment based on the actual TSL or system specification language used in the target environment.
