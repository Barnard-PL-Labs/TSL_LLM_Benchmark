Given the predicates to be implemented and the API description provided, here is the TSL template you might use to implement these predicates in a system description language format. Since we are not directly coding in JavaScript but rather describing the functionality for a TSL-based system, I will outline how you might set these up in a TSL "always assume" and "always guarantee" format.

```tsl
always assume {
    // Define the predicates based on the conditions provided
    isLessThanPoint75(total) <-> total < 0.75;
    isLessThanOne(total) <-> total < 1;
    isLessThanOnePoint25(total) <-> total < 1.25;
    pressD(e) <-> e == 'd';
    pressQ(e) <-> e == 'q';
    pressO(e) <-> e == 'o';
    press1(e) <-> e == '1';
    press2(e) <-> e == '2';
    press3(e) <-> e == '3';
    pressR(e) <-> e == 'r';
}

always guarantee {
    // Actions or guarantees based on the predicates might go here.
    // Since no actions are specified, this section remains empty or filled with hypothetical guarantees.
}
```

### Explanation:
- `always assume` block declares assumptions or conditions about the environment or system inputs. In this case, we're assuming that the predicates are determined by comparing `total` to specific values or checking if `e` matches certain key presses.

- `always guarantee` block defines the system's response or guarantees based on the assumptions. Since your request did not specify what to do based on these predicates, this section is left mostly empty. You'd typically fill this with reactions or actions the system should take when certain conditions (defined in `always assume`) are met.

This TSL setup ensures that the predicates are defined in a way that they can be used to control or dictate system behavior according to the states of `total` and `e`. If you had specific actions or outcomes based on these predicates, they would be outlined in the `always guarantee` section.
