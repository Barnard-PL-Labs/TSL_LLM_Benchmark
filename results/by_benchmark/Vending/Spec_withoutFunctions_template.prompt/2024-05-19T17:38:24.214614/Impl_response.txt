To implement the predicates using the TSL template, given the API provided, we'll structure our code under the `always assume` and `always guarantee` sections. Since no actual JavaScript implementation is required, we'll focus on outlining the predicates in the TSL context.

Here is how you can define the predicates using the TSL template, assuming "total" and "e" (event) are inputs from the environment:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Describe the nature of the inputs
  (total is a number); // assuming total is continuously updated based on currency input
  (e is an event);      // e represents an event possibly from keyboard input
}

always guarantee {
  // Define the predicates based on the provided descriptions

  // Predicates for checking the total amount
  isLessThanPoint75(total) -> (total < 0.75);
  isLessThanOne(total) -> (total < 1.0);
  isLessThanOnePoint25(total) -> (total < 1.25);

  // Predicates for checking which key is pressed
  pressD(e) -> (e.key == 'd');
  pressQ(e) -> (e.key == 'q');
  pressO(e) -> (e.key == 'o');
  press1(e) -> (e.key == '1');
  press2(e) -> (e.key == '2');
  press3(e) -> (e.key == '3');
  pressR(e) -> (e.key == 'r');
}
```

Explanation:
- Each predicate is defined in the `always guarantee` section because that's where we want to specify how the system reacts based on the conditions met from the inputs.
- The conditions `(e.key == 'x')` simulate checking which key is pressed. This depends on the system API and how it provides events for key pressesâ€”`e.key` represents the key attribute in an event `e`.
- For the `total` comparisons, we are straightforwardly comparing the total with the specified amounts.

This TSL template ensures that all conditions and interactions described by the predicates are continuously evaluated and adhered to by the system.
