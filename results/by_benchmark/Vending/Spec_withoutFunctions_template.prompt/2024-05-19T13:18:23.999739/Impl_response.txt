To create a system that adheres to the predicates described using Temporal Stream Logic (TSL) without implementing any functions in JavaScript, we focus on defining the logical conditions based on the provided predicates related to the vending machine's signals and key presses. Below is how you would set up the TSL template:

```tsl
always assume {
    // Define the conditions on the 'total' cell.
    (total < 0.75) <-> isLessThanPoint75(total);
    (total < 1.0) <-> isLessThanOne(total);
    (total < 1.25) <-> isLessThanOnePoint25(total);
    
    // Define the conditions on the 'e' cell for different key presses.
    (e == 'd') <-> pressD(e);
    (e == 'q') <-> pressQ(e);
    (e == 'o') <-> pressO(e);
    (e == '1') <-> press1(e);
    (e == '2') <-> press2(e);
    (e == '3') <-> press3(e);
    (e == 'r') <-> pressR(e);
}
always guarantee {
    // Based on the system's requirement, define how the system should behave
    // when these predicates are true. These are hypothetical examples:

    // If total is less than $0.75, maybe the machine should display a message.
    isLessThanPoint75(total) -> [displayMessage <- "Add more funds to make a purchase."];

    // Handling of button presses to maybe log or perform actions.
    pressD(e) -> [logKey <- "Pressed D"];
    pressQ(e) -> [logKey <- "Pressed Q"];
    pressO(e) -> [logKey <- "Pressed O"];
    press1(e) -> [logKey <- "Pressed 1"];
    press2(e) -> [logKey <- "Pressed 2"];
    press3(e) -> [logKey <- "Pressed 3"];
    pressR(e) -> [logKey <- "Pressed R"];
}
```

This layout assumes that there are cells `total` and `e` that control the vending machine's operations and the user's interactions via key presses, respectively. Each predicate's truth value is directly related to these states, and the `always assume` block binds these truth values to conditions in the system's state (`total` and `e`). Meanwhile, the `always guarantee` block defines system outputs or actions based on these conditions, which could be adjusted depending on specific system requirements.
