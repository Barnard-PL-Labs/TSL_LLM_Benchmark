To address the requirements provided for the vending machine's operation, we can structure the predicates using Temporal Stream Logic (TSL) with JavaScript-like pseudocode syntax to define how the TSL system should interpret and handle the predicates based on the cell values and events described in the system's API.

Here's the TSL implementation using the provided descriptions:

### TSL Implementation

```tsl
always assume {
  // Define predicates based on the 'total' cell value
  isLessThanPoint75(total) -> (total < 0.75);
  isLessThanOne(total) -> (total < 1);
  isLessThanOnePoint25(total) -> (total < 1.25);

  // Define predicates based on the 'e' cell value denoting keyboard events
  pressD(e) -> (e == 'd');
  pressQ(e) -> (e == 'q');
  pressO(e) -> (e == 'o');
  press1(e) -> (e == '1');
  press2(e) -> (e == '2');
  press3(e) -> (e == '3');
  pressR(e) -> (e == 'r');
}

always guarantee {
  // Here we could set up responses or actions to the predicates, but since the prompt asks not to implement any functions or additional logic beyond defining the predicates, this section is left empty as per the instructions.
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Predicates Related to 'total' Cell**: These predicates check if the value of the 'total' cell is less than certain amounts (0.75, 1, and 1.25). These might be used to determine if enough money has been inserted for various products in a vending machine.

2. **Predicates Related to 'e' Cell**: These predicates determine which key has been pressed. This assumes the 'e' cell contains the last character input from a keypad or similar input device attached to the vending machine. The predicates check if the input matches specific characters, which likely correspond to different product selections or commands.

3. **always assume**: This section ensures that the predicates are correctly defined based on the system's input values. It establishes the conditions under which the predicates are true.

4. **always guarantee**: As there's no requirement for implementing actions or logic beyond predicate definition, this section doesn't contain any operational code. Typically, this section would define how the system behaves or reacts when certain conditions defined in the `always assume` block are met.

This TSL setup allows the vending machine's embedded system to continuously evaluate these conditions and make decisions accordingly in a real-time operating environment.
