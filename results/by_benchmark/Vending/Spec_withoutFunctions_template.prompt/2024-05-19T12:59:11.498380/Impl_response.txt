In TSL (Temporal Stream Logic), we define the predicates related to the system environment without implementing JavaScript functions directly. However, we can understand how to express these predicates within a typical TSL template. Below, we will outline the necessary predicates for the vending machine system:

### TSL Template for Vending Machine Environment

```tsl
always assume {
    // Describes the state of the 'total' cell and 'e' cell (event or signal from user interaction)
}

always guarantee {
    // Predicate definitions based on cell 'total'
    (total < 0.75) -> [isLessThanPoint75 <- true];
    !(total < 0.75) -> [isLessThanPoint75 <- false];

    (total < 1) -> [isLessThanOne <- true];
    !(total < 1) -> [isLessThanOne <- false];

    (total < 1.25) -> [isLessThanOnePoint25 <- true];
    !(total < 1.25) -> [isLessThanOnePoint25 <- false];

    // Predicate definitions based on cell 'e' for key presses
    (e == 'd') -> [pressD <- true];
    !(e == 'd') -> [pressD <- false];

    (e == 'q') -> [pressQ <- true];
    !(e == 'q') -> [pressQ <- false];

    (e == 'o') -> [pressO <- true];
    !(e == 'o') -> [pressO <- false];

    (e == '1') -> [press1 <- true];
    !(e == '1') -> [press1 <- false];

    (e == '2') -> [press2 <- true];
    !(e == '2') -> [press2 <- false];

    (e == '3') -> [press3 <- true];
    !(e == '3') -> [press3 <- false];

    (e == 'r') -> [pressR <- true];
    !(e == 'r') -> [pressR <- false];
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Assumptions**: This section is generally used to describe environmental inputs or conditions. Here, it would represent signals coming from the 'total' and 'e' cells.
  
- **Guarantees**: This section outlines how the system should react based on the assumptions. Each predicate is translated into a condition check within the TSL environment. The conditions are set for less than checks on the 'total' and specific key press checks on 'e'.

Each predicate such as `isLessThanPoint75`, `pressD`, `pressQ`, etc., is represented as a condition on the respective cell ('total' or 'e'). These predicates help in defining the system's temporal behavior and logical operations based on user interactions and system states.
