Given the scenario, we need to translate the described predicates into TSL (Temporal Stream Logic) while considering the given API constraints. Here's the TSL representation for the predicates described:

```tsl
always assume {
    // Predicate definitions to represent the state based on the values of 'total' and 'e'
    isLessThanPoint75(total) -> (total < 0.75);
    isLessThanOne(total) -> (total < 1);
    isLessThanOnePoint25(total) -> (total < 1.25);
    pressD(e) -> (e == 'd');
    pressQ(e) -> (e == 'q');
    pressO(e) -> (e == 'o');
    press1(e) -> (e == '1');
    press2(e) -> (e == '2');
    press3(e) -> (e == '3');
    pressR(e) -> (e == 'r');
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Predicates involving `total`:** These predicates check if the value of `total` is less than specific amounts (0.75, 1, and 1.25). These values are likely thresholds at which different functionalities or permissions in the vending machine system are enabled or disabled.

2. **Predicates involving `e`:** These predicates determine actions based on the key pressed (detected through the signal `e`). The system defines specific keys (`d`, `q`, `o`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `r`) and the predicates check if one of these keys is the current state of `e`.

### Usage:
These predicates can be used within the TSL environment to define rules or behaviors of the system based on the state of `total` and the input from `e`. For instance, you might use these predicates to control access to certain products in a vending machine, or to handle user input in a menu system, applying actions or changes based on what keys are pressed and the current credit total.

### Note:
This TSL snippet assumes that `total` and `e` are cells or signals that are updated based on the system's input and state. The actual methods for updating these values (like receiving key presses or calculating totals) are managed elsewhere in the system, outside of the TSL environment. The TSL code assumes these values are provided correctly and focuses on defining the logic based on their states.
