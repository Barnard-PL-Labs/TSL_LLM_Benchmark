In the JavaScript environment, based on the requirements provided and the API description (which is essentially non-existent in this case), we can define the predicates directly. As there is no wrapper or specific API methods provided for interfacing with the cells or the input events, we'll assume basic interactions with these cells and key events. Here are the implementations of the predicates:

```javascript
// Predicates related to the 'total' cell
function isLessThanPoint75(total) {
    return total < 0.75;
}

function isLessThanOne(total) {
    return total < 1;
}

function isLessThanOnePoint25(total) {
    return total < 1.25;
}

// Predicates related to the 'e' cell which represents key events
function pressD(e) {
    return e.key === 'd';
}

function pressQ(e) {
    return e.key === 'q';
}

function pressO(e) {
    return e.key === 'o';
}

function press1(e) {
    return e.key === '1';
}

function press2(e) {
    return e.key === '2';
}

function press3(e) {
    return e.key === '3';
}

function pressR(e) {
    return e.key === 'r';
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Total Related Predicates:** These predicates check if the value of `total` is less than a certain threshold. They take the `total` value as an argument and directly compare it using less-than operations.

2. **Event Related Predicates:** These predicates check if a specific key was pressed. They take an event object `e` which is assumed to have a property `key` that indicates which key was pressed. The predicate returns `true` if the pressed key matches the one specified in the function.

### Usage:
These functions would be used within the context of event listeners or condition checks, where `total` represents a numeric state or `e` is an event object received from a keypress event. Here is an example of how you might use these predicates in an event listener setup:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('keydown', (event) => {
    if (pressD(event)) {
        console.log("D key was pressed");
    }
    if (pressQ(event)) {
        console.log("Q key was pressed");
    }
    // Additional key checks can be placed here...
});

// Assuming `total` is being updated somewhere in your application:
let total = 0.5;
if (isLessThanPoint75(total)) {
    console.log("Total is less than 0.75");
}
```

This setup assumes standard JavaScript event handling and straightforward condition checking.
