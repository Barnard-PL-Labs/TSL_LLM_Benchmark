To implement the predicates for the vending machine scenario using Temporal Stream Logic (TSL), we need to describe the behavior based on the predicates provided. Below is the TSL template that addresses the predicates defined:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Assumptions about the input signals from the environment.
  (total < 0.75) <-> isLessThanPoint75(total);
  (total < 1) <-> isLessThanOne(total);
  (total < 1.25) <-> isLessThanOnePoint25(total);
  (e == 'd') <-> pressD(e);
  (e == 'q') <-> pressQ(e);
  (e == 'o') <-> pressO(e);
  (e == '1') <-> press1(e);
  (e == '2') <-> press2(e);
  (e == '3') <-> press3(e);
  (e == 'r') <-> pressR(e);
}

always guarantee {
  // Guarantees based on the predicates - here you would define how the system should react based on the inputs.
  // Example:
  isLessThanPoint75(total) -> [display <- "Add more coins"];
  isLessThanOne(total) -> [display <- "Add more coins"];
  isLessThanOnePoint25(total) -> [display <- "Add more coins"];

  // Handling button presses:
  pressD(e) -> [vend <- drink];
  pressQ(e) -> [vend <- snack];
  pressO(e) -> [togglePower()];
  press1(e) -> [selectItem(1)];
  press2(e) -> [selectItem(2)];
  press3(e) -> [selectItem(3)];
  pressR(e) -> [resetMachine()];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **always assume** - This section is used to define the correlations between the actual values of `total` and `e`, and the predicates such as `isLessThanPoint75(total)`. This helps in translating the real-world conditions into boolean predicates that can be used to control logic in the TSL framework.

2. **always guarantee** - In this section, you define the system's responses to the various conditions outlined in the predicates. Each predicate, when true, triggers a certain action or sets a system variable. For example:
   - If `total` is less than 0.75, the system might display a message asking the user to "Add more coins".
   - If the user presses 'd', the system dispenses a drink by triggering the `vend` action with the parameter 'drink'.

This TSL template provides a structured approach to defining the logic of a vending machine system based on the inputs and the conditions specified by the predicates.
