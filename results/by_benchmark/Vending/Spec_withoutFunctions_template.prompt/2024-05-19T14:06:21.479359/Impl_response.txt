To implement the predicates provided in the description using Temporal Stream Logic (TSL) for a vending machine system, consider the following:

### Predicates
These predicates are Boolean expressions that return true or false based on the current state or input signals of the system.
```tsl
always assume {
    // Define the predicates based on the 'total' cell
    isLessThanPoint75(total) <-> total < 0.75;
    isLessThanOne(total) <-> total < 1;
    isLessThanOnePoint25(total) <-> total < 1.25;

    // Define the predicates based on the 'e' cell (event or input received)
    pressD(e) <-> e == 'D';
    pressQ(e) <-> e == 'Q';
    pressO(e) <-> e == 'O';
    press1(e) <-> e == '1';
    press2(e) <-> e == '2';
    press3(e) <-> e == '3';
    pressR(e) <-> e == 'R';
}

always guarantee {
    // No specific actions to guarantee, as we're only defining predicates.
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Cell "total" Predicates**:
    - `isLessThanPoint75(total)`: Checks if the value of `total` is less than 0.75.
    - `isLessThanOne(total)`: Checks if the value of `total` is less than 1.
    - `isLessThanOnePoint25(total)`: Checks if the value of `total` is less than 1.25.

2. **Cell "e" Predicates**:
    - `pressD(e)`: Checks if the key 'D' has been pressed.
    - `pressQ(e)`: Checks if the key 'Q' has been pressed.
    - `pressO(e)`: Checks if the key 'O' has been pressed.
    - `press1(e)`: Checks if the key '1' has been pressed.
    - `press2(e)`: Checks if the key '2' has been pressed.
    - `press3(e)`: Checks if the key '3' has been pressed.
    - `pressR(e)`: Checks if the key 'R' has been pressed.

### Usage in a TSL System:
This TSL setup defines the logical behavior for the predicates based on the system's state. It refrains from defining actions (as part of `always guarantee`) since the task specifies only to define predicates. These predicates can be used within the system to make decisions or trigger other actions based on their truth values, integrating seamlessly with other parts of the TSL definitions where specific behaviors or guarantees are required.
