To implement the predicates described using Temporal Stream Logic (TSL) for the vending machine, we utilize temporal operators and logical connectives to specify the behavior over time. Here is how the predicates can be defined in TSL within the context of an `always assume` and `always guarantee` sections. Since TSL is a formal language for specifying system behavior, we assume that the cell values and events like key presses can be directly referenced in the logic.

```tsl
always assume {
    // Define the value conditions for the total cell
    (total < 0.75) -> isLessThanPoint75(total);
    (total < 1) -> isLessThanOne(total);
    (total < 1.25) -> isLessThanOnePoint25(total);
    
    // Define the event conditions for the e cell representing key presses
    (e == 'd') -> pressD(e);
    (e == 'q') -> pressQ(e);
    (e == 'o') -> pressO(e);
    (e == '1') -> press1(e);
    (e == '2') -> press2(e);
    (e == '3') -> press3(e);
    (e == 'r') -> pressR(e);
}

always guarantee {
    // This section usually contains system guarantees based on the assumptions
    // Example guarantees can be added based on requirements
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Predicates for `total`:** Each predicate checking the condition of `total` is linked to a corresponding boolean return condition. These conditions ensure that the predicates correctly reflect the state of `total` as less than certain values.

2. **Predicates for `e`:** Each predicate for the key presses checks if the current state of `e` matches specific characters. This setup ensures that the system can detect and properly respond to user key presses as described.

3. **Structure:** The TSL template is divided into `always assume` and `always guarantee` sections, where `always assume` is used to define the incoming conditions or constraints of the system, and `always guarantee` would be used to define how the system should respond to these conditions. The response part is left generic here, as the exact system reactions or methods are not specified.

This TSL setup ensures that the vending machine's system behavior adheres to the predicates based on the current state of `total` and key presses captured in `e`.
