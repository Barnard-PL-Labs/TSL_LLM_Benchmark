To implement the predicates mentioned using the JavaScript language, you would typically create functions that return boolean values based on certain conditions. Here, predicates will be designed as functions to evaluate conditions based on the values of the cells 'total' and 'e'. 

Here is how you can implement these predicates:

```javascript
// Predicate to check if the total is less than 0.75
function isLessThanPoint75(total) {
    return total < 0.75;
}

// Predicate to check if the total is less than 1
function isLessThanOne(total) {
    return total < 1;
}

// Predicate to check if the total is less than 1.25
function isLessThanOnePoint25(total) {
    return total < 1.25;
}

// Predicate to check if the 'd' key is pressed
function pressD(e) {
    return e === 'd';
}

// Predicate to check if the 'q' key is pressed
function pressQ(e) {
    return e === 'q';
}

// Predicate to check if the 'o' key is pressed
function pressO(e) {
    return e === 'o';
}

// Predicate to check if the '1' key is pressed
function press1(e) {
    return e === '1';
}

// Predicate to check if the '2' key is pressed
function press2(e) {
    return e === '2';
}

// Predicate to check if the '3' key is pressed
function press3(e) {
    return e === '3';
}

// Predicate to check if the 'r' key is pressed
function pressR(e) {
    return e === 'r';
}
```

### Usage

These predicates can be used in a JavaScript environment where 'total' and 'e' values are available. For example, in a vending machine system, these predicates could be used to determine the system's behavior based on user input and the total amount inserted:

```javascript
let total = 0.50;
let keyPress = 'd';

if (isLessThanPoint75(total)) {
    console.log("Total is less than 0.75");
}

if (pressD(keyPress)) {
    console.log("D key was pressed");
}
```

This setup assumes 'total' and 'e' values are correctly assigned and updated within your environment. The predicates check conditions based on these values to direct the flow of operations or user interactions in your application.
