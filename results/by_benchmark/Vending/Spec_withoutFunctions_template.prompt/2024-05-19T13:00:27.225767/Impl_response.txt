To implement the predicates described for the vending machine system in Temporal Stream Logic (TSL), you can define them using the `always assume` clause for inputs from the environment and the `always guarantee` clause for the system's response to these inputs. Since you requested not to use JavaScript functions but to use TSL, here's how you might write these predicates:

```tsl
always assume {
    // Predicates for the "total" cell
    (total < 0.75) ;
    (total < 1) ;
    (total < 1.25) ;
  
    // Predicates for the "e" cell identifying key presses
    (e == 'd') ;
    (e == 'q') ;
    (e == 'o') ;
    (e == '1') ;
    (e == '2') ;
    (e == '3') ;
    (e == 'r') ;
}

always guarantee {
    // Example of how guarantees might be used:
    // If e is 'd', do some action (this is just an illustration, as no specific actions are requested)
    (e == 'd') -> [ /* action to perform */ ];
}
```

In this TSL template:

- Each predicate is expressed in terms of a comparison or equality check, tailored to how TSL might interpret these expressions based on the API's capabilities. For example, `e == 'd'` checks if the key 'd' is pressed.
- The `always assume` block is used to describe possible conditions or states based on inputs, such as different key presses or total amount conditions.
- The `always guarantee` block is where the system's reaction to these inputs is specified. Though you requested not to use JavaScript functions, this section typically indicates what the system should do when conditions in the `always assume` block are met.

Since TSL is a theoretical representation in this context and actual implementation details like function calls or hardware interactions aren't specified, the exact actions in the `always guarantee` are placeholders for where you would incorporate system responses.
