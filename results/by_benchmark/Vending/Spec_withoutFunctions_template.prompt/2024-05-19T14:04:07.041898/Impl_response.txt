To fulfill the requirements of the system environment as described, we need to implement the predicates using the provided "cells" and the system's handling of events or signals. Since we are not implementing any functions and focusing only on predicates, the JavaScript implementation below directly translates the predicate requirements into the system's logic using simple conditional statements.

Here is how you can implement the predicates using JavaScript:

```javascript
// Predicates for checking the total value
function isLessThanPoint75(total) {
    return total < 0.75;
}

function isLessThanOne(total) {
    return total < 1;
}

function isLessThanOnePoint25(total) {
    return total < 1.25;
}

// Predicates for handling key press events
function pressD(e) {
    return e.key === 'd';
}

function pressQ(e) {
    return e.key === 'q';
}

function pressO(e) {
    return e.key === 'o';
}

function press1(e) {
    return e.key === '1';
}

function press2(e) {
    return e.key === '2';
}

function press3(e) {
    return e.key === '3';
}

function pressR(e) {
    return e.key === 'r';
}
```

### Key Points:
1. Each predicate function takes an argument (`total` for the value-related predicates and `e` for the event-related predicates).
2. The total value predicates directly compare the `total` argument with a fixed number.
3. The event predicates check if the key pressed (`e.key`) matches a specific character, corresponding to the function's intent (e.g., `pressD(e)` checks if the key 'd' was pressed).

This setup assumes that `total` and `e` are provided correctly by the context in which these predicates are used, such as event handlers or other parts of the system that manage state or handle inputs.
