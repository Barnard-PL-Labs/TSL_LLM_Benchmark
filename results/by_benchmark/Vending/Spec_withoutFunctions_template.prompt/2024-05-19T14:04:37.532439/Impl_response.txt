Based on the predicates you need implemented for the vending machine and given the description, here's how you would define them using JavaScript. These predicates will return `true` or `false` based on the conditions described:

```javascript
// Predicates related to the total cell
function isLessThanPoint75(total) {
    return total < 0.75;
}

function isLessThanOne(total) {
    return total < 1;
}

function isLessThanOnePoint25(total) {
    return total < 1.25;
}

// Predicates related to the e cell where e is assumed to represent an event object
function pressD(e) {
    return e.key === 'd';
}

function pressQ(e) {
    return e.key === 'q';
}

function pressO(e) {
    return e.key === 'o';
}

function press1(e) {
    return e.key === '1';
}

function press2(e) {
    return e.key === '2';
}

function press3(e) {
    return e.key === '3';
}

function pressR(e) {
    return e.key === 'r';
}
```

### Usage
These functions should be used in the context where `total` represents the current total amount entered into the vending machine and `e` is an event object typically obtained from event listeners in a web environment. For example, when a key is pressed, an event is fired that includes which key was pressed. 

### Example
Here's how you might use one of these predicates in an event handler:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
    if (pressQ(event)) {
        console.log('Q key was pressed');
    }
});
```

Similarly, you could check the total before allowing an operation:

```javascript
let total = 0.5; // This would normally be dynamically calculated
if (isLessThanPoint75(total)) {
    console.log('Total is less than $0.75');
}
```

These implementations assume that `total` is passed directly to the predicate functions and `e` represents an event object captured by JavaScript event listeners for keyboard interactions. Adjustments might be needed based on the actual data structures and state management of your application.
