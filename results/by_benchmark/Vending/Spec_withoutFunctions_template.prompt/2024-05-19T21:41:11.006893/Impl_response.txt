To implement the given predicates in TSL (Temporal Stream Logic) for the specified vending machine system, we'll define assumptions and guarantees based on the provided predicates. Since we are not implementing functions and there's no specific wrapper API information, we'll focus only on the predicates.

### TSL Template Implementation

We'll structure the TSL template in two parts: `always assume` and `always guarantee`. For simplicity and clarity in this example, we'll assume that the predicates are directly represented as signals that can be used to control or influence the vending machine's behavior.

```tsl
always assume {
    // Predicate signal definitions for `total` and `e` actions
    isLessThanPoint75(total);  // Checks if total is less than $0.75
    isLessThanOne(total);      // Checks if total is less than $1.00
    isLessThanOnePoint25(total); // Checks if total is less than $1.25
    pressD(e);                // Checks if 'D' key is pressed
    pressQ(e);                // Checks if 'Q' key is pressed
    pressO(e);                // Checks if 'O' key is pressed
    press1(e);                // Checks if '1' key is pressed
    press2(e);                // Checks if '2' key is pressed
    press3(e);                // Checks if '3' key is pressed
    pressR(e);                // Checks if 'R' key is pressed
}

always guarantee {
    // Here you might define how the vending machine behaves based on these inputs
    // Example behavior (hypothetical as there are no functions to implement):
    isLessThanPoint75(total) -> [displayMessage <- "Insufficient amount for any item"];
    isLessThanOne(total) && !isLessThanPoint75(total) -> [displayMessage <- "Can buy item A or B"];
    isLessThanOnePoint25(total) && !isLessThanOne(total) -> [displayMessage <- "Can buy item A, B, or C"];
    
    // Responding to button presses
    pressQ(e) -> [cancelTransaction <- true]; // Hypothetical command to cancel the transaction
    pressD(e) -> [dispenseItem <- true]; // Hypothetical command to dispense an item
    pressO(e) -> [openServicePanel <- true]; // Open service panel
    press1(e) -> [selectItem1 <- true]; // Select item 1
    press2(e) -> [selectItem2 <- true]; // Select item 2
    press3(e) -> [selectItem3 <- true]; // Select item 3
    pressR(e) -> [resetMachine <- true]; // Reset the machine
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Assumptions**: Here, we assume the various states defined by predicates such as checking the amount inserted (`total`) and the button presses (`e`). These predicates control the flow of the TSL template.

2. **Guarantees**: This part defines the system's actions in response to the changes in its inputs. For example, if the total is less than $0.75, the system might display a message indicating insufficient funds. Similarly, actions corresponding to button presses like cancelling a transaction or dispensing an item are defined.

Since there is no actual implementation or function definition required, this TSL setup virtually maps the predicates to hypothetical system actions.
