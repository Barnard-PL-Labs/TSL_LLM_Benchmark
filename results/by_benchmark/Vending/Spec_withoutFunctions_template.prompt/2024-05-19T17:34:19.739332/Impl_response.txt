Below is the JavaScript implementation for the predicates required for the vending machine system, using an assumed API structure for interacting with the vending machine states and user key presses. Since the actual API methods for getting the state of `total` and `e` are not specified, they will be treated generically. The implementation assumes functions like `getKeyState()` to check key presses and a globally accessible variable `total`.

```javascript
// Predicates

/**
 * Checks if the total amount is less than $0.75.
 * @param {number} total - The current total amount in the vending machine.
 * @returns {boolean} True if the total is less than $0.75, false otherwise.
 */
function isLessThanPoint75(total) {
    return total < 0.75;
}

/**
 * Checks if the total amount is less than $1.00.
 * @param {number} total - The current total amount in the vending machine.
 * @returns {boolean} True if the total is less than $1.00, false otherwise.
 */
function isLessThanOne(total) {
    return total < 1.00;
}

/**
 * Checks if the total amount is less than $1.25.
 * @param {number} total - The current total amount in the vending machine.
 * @returns {boolean} True if the total is less than $1.25, false otherwise.
 */
function isLessThanOnePoint25(total) {
    return total < 1.25;
}

/**
 * Checks if the 'D' key was pressed.
 * @param {object} e - The event object containing details about the key press.
 * @returns {boolean} True if the 'D' key was pressed, false otherwise.
 */
function pressD(e) {
    return getKeyState('D') === true;
}

/**
 * Checks if the 'Q' key was pressed.
 * @param {object} e - The event object containing details about the key press.
 * @returns {boolean} True if the 'Q' key was pressed, false otherwise.
 */
function pressQ(e) {
    return getKeyState('Q') === true;
}

/**
 * Checks if the 'O' key was pressed.
 * @param {object} e - The event object containing details about the key press.
 * @returns {boolean} True if the 'O' key was pressed, false otherwise.
 */
function pressO(e) {
    return getKeyState('O') === true;
}

/**
 * Checks if the '1' key was pressed.
 * @param {object} e - The event object containing details about the key press.
 * @returns {boolean} True if the '1' key was pressed, false otherwise.
 */
function press1(e) {
    return getKeyState('1') === true;
}

/**
 * Checks if the '2' key was pressed.
 * @param {object} e - The event object containing details about the key press.
 * @returns {boolean} True if the '2' key was pressed, false otherwise.
 */
function press2(e) {
    return getKeyState('2') === true;
}

/**
 * Checks if the '3' key was pressed.
 * @param {object} e - The event object containing details about the key press.
 * @returns {boolean} True if the '3' key was pressed, false otherwise.
 */
function press3(e) {
    return getKeyState('3') === true;
}

/**
 * Checks if the 'R' key was pressed.
 * @param {object} e - The event object containing details about the key press.
 * @returns {boolean} True if the 'R' key was pressed, false otherwise.
 */
function pressR(e) {
    return getKeyState('R') === true;
}

/**
 * A helper function to simulate getting the state of a key.
 * This should be replaced with actual API methods if available.
 * @param {string} key - The key to check.
 * @returns {boolean} True if the key is pressed, false otherwise.
 */
function getKeyState(key) {
    // Simulated function; replace with actual API call if available.
    return document.getElementById('key-' + key).checked; // Example using checkbox inputs to simulate key presses.
}
```

Note that the `getKeyState()` function is a placeholder and should be replaced with the appropriate method from your system's API to get the state of keyboard inputs or other input methods.
