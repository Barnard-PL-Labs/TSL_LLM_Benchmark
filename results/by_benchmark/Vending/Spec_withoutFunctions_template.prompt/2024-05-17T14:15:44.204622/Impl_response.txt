To implement the specified predicates in a TSL (Temporal Stream Language) format using the information provided, you'll need to define the predicates as logical expressions within the `always assume` block of a TSL template. Since the predicates are all boolean expressions, they are naturally represented in the form of conditions on the inputs.

Here's how you can define these predicates within a TSL context. Note that since no specific API functions are provided for checking keyboard inputs or cell values, the actual implementation assumes such functions exist based on your description.

```tsl
always assume {
    // Predicate definitions for "total" cell comparisons
    isLessThanPoint75(total) := total < 0.75;
    isLessThanOne(total) := total < 1;
    isLessThanOnePoint25(total) := total < 1.25;

    // Predicate definitions for "e" cell keyboard inputs
    pressD(e) := e == 'd';
    pressQ(e) := e == 'q';
    pressO(e) := e == 'o';
    press1(e) := e == '1';
    press2(e) := e == '2';
    press3(e) := e == '3';
    pressR(e) := e == 'r';
}
```

### Explanation:
- The `:=` operator is used to define the predicates within the TSL environment. This is an assumed notation for setting a specification, as TSL typically does not use such a definition format directly. Adjustments might be necessary depending on the actual syntax and capabilities of the environment or tool you're using.
- Each predicate is written as a simple comparison or equality check, which evaluates to true or false based on the current state of inputs `total` or `e`.
- Since JavaScript or any actual programming language functions are not being used directly here, this example is purely conceptual within the TSL domain, assuming it can interpret such definitions.

### Note:
- If you are implementing these predicates in a real software system, you would need actual functions or methods to access the values of `total` and `e` and compare them accordingly. This would typically be done in the programming language used for the system, like JavaScript, with functions that return boolean values.
- The above TSL representation is theoretical and serves to illustrate how you might describe the behavior or constraints of such predicates in a specification language like TSL, assuming it supports such expressions directly.
