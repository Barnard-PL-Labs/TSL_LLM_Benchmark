Given the task of implementing predicates for a vending machine system, and given the non-existence of system API wrappings, let's define our predicates directly:

### TSL Template for the Vending Machine System

Let's define the predicates in the TSL template which will help in controlling the logic of the vending machine based on the inputs and the amount of total money received.

```tsl
always assume {
    // Define predicates based on the 'total' cell
    isLessThanPoint75(total) <- (total < 0.75);
    isLessThanOne(total) <- (total < 1.00);
    isLessThanOnePoint25(total) <- (total < 1.25);

    // Define predicates based on the state of the signal 'e' representing key presses
    pressD(e) <- (e == 'd');
    pressQ(e) <- (e == 'q');
    pressO(e) <- (e == 'o');
    press1(e) <- (e == '1');
    press2(e) <- (e == '2');
    press3(e) <- (e == '3');
    pressR(e) <- (e == 'r');
}

always guarantee {
    // The guarantee logic would be defined here based on the above assumptions
    // Example:
    press1(e) -> [total <- total + 0.25] W pressR(e);
    press2(e) -> [total <- total + 0.50] W pressR(e);
    press3(e) -> [total <- total + 1.00] W pressR(e);
    pressQ(e) -> [dispenseItem <- 'soda'] W (isLessThanOne(total) -> [error <- 'Insufficient funds']);
    pressD(e) -> [dispenseItem <- 'chips'] W (isLessThanPoint75(total) -> [error <- 'Insufficient funds']);
    pressO(e) -> [dispenseItem <- 'candy'] W (isLessThanOnePoint25(total) -> [error <- 'Insufficient funds']);
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **always assume**: This section describes the conditions or the inputs from the environment. Each predicate here is a declaration of how the system should interpret the inputs. For example, `pressD(e) <- (e == 'd');` checks if the input `e` is equivalent to the character 'd', indicating the 'd' key was pressed.

2. **always guarantee**: This section determines the system's guaranteed responses based on the assumptions. For example, `press1(e) -> [total <- total + 0.25] W pressR(e);` will keep adding 0.25 to the total as long as '1' key is pressed until the 'r' key resets or interrupts this operation.

By setting up these predicates and guarantees in a TSL template, the vending machine's logic becomes structured and responsive to dynamic input states, allowing for complex interactions like handling monetary input and dispensing items based on sufficient funds.
