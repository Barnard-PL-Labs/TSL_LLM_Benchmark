To implement the described predicates using the TSL (Temporal Stream Logic) framework for a vending machine system, the following code outlines the assumptions and guarantees based on the input signals from the environment and the actions the system should take in response to these signals. Since there are no specific functions to implement and the system API doesn't provide explicit details on how to interact with the system, the TSL model focuses on conditionally evaluating states and actions based on the predefined predicates.

Here's the TSL template for the vending machine system:

```tsl
always assume {
    // Define the cell values for total and e from the system's environment
}

always guarantee {
    // Predicates for checking the total cost in the vending machine
    isLessThanPoint75(total) -> (total < 0.75);
    isLessThanOne(total) -> (total < 1.0);
    isLessThanOnePoint25(total) -> (total < 1.25);

    // Predicates for button press events based on the state of 'e'
    pressD(e) -> (e == 'd');
    pressQ(e) -> (e == 'q');
    pressO(e) -> (e == 'o');
    press1(e) -> (e == '1');
    press2(e) -> (e == '2');
    press3(e) -> (e == '3');
    pressR(e) -> (e == 'r');
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions** (`always assume`): 
   - Here, we'd define any environmental conditions or states that the system requires to function correctly. For example, it could include the setup of monitoring the cell values for `total` and `e`, which might include initializing or updating these values based on certain conditions.

2. **Guarantees** (`always guarantee`):
   - **Cost Checking**: The system checks if the `total` cost in the vending machine is less than specific values (0.75, 1.00, and 1.25). These predicates help in determining what items can be purchased or what actions to enable based on the amount entered.
   - **Button Press Events**: The system evaluates whether specific buttons ('d', 'q', 'o', '1', '2', '3', 'r') are pressed. These predicates are used to trigger certain actions in the vending machine, such as dispensing items, cancelling transactions, or other custom functions.

This TSL implementation provides a structure that ensures the vending machine responds appropriately to user inputs and maintains the integrity of its operational logic based on the total money inserted. Each predicate serves as a condition to guide the system's actions, ensuring reliable and predictable behavior.
