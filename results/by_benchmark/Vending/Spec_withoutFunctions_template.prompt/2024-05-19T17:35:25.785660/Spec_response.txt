Here's the TSL specification for the described vending machine system, following the structure and instructions provided:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Mutual exclusion for all button inputs
  !(pressD(e) && pressQ(e));
  !(pressD(e) && pressO(e));
  !(pressD(e) && press1(e));
  !(pressD(e) && press2(e));
  !(pressD(e) && press3(e));
  !(pressD(e) && pressR(e));

  !(pressQ(e) && pressO(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && press1(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && press2(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && press3(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && pressR(e));

  !(pressO(e) && press1(e));
  !(pressO(e) && press2(e));
  !(pressO(e) && press3(e));
  !(pressO(e) && pressR(e));

  !(press1(e) && press2(e));
  !(press1(e) && press3(e));
  !(press1(e) && pressR(e));

  !(press2(e) && press3(e));
  !(press2(e) && pressR(e));

  !(press3(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Increment total by 0.1 when pressD is pushed
  pressD(e) -> [total <- total + 0.1];

  // Increment total by 0.25 when pressQ is pushed
  pressQ(e) -> [total <- total + 0.25];

  // Increment total by 1 when pressO is pushed
  pressO(e) -> [total <- total + 1];

  // Decrement total by 0.75 when press1 is pushed and total is >= 0.75
  press1(e) && !isLessThanPoint75(total) -> [total <- total - 0.75];

  // Decrement total by 1 when press2 is pushed and total is >= 1
  press2(e) && !isLessThanOne(total) -> [total <- total - 1];

  // Decrement total by 1.25 when press3 is pushed and total is >= 1.25
  press3(e) && !isLessThanOnePoint25(total) -> [total <- total - 1.25];

  // Reset total to 0 when pressR is pushed
  pressR(e) -> [total <- 0];
}
```

In this TSL specification:
- Mutual exclusion assumptions ensure that no two operations can occur simultaneously, reflecting the requirement that no two machine operations can be performed at the same time.
- The guarantees define the system behavior in response to various button presses, including incrementing or decrementing the total value stored in the vending machine or resetting it, depending on the conditions defined by the predicates and the respective button presses.
