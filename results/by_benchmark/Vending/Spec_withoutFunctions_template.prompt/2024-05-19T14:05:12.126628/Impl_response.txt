To implement the predicate functions specified in the scenario using a TSL framework, we need to define each predicate as a boolean expression that evaluates the conditions on the given signals `total` and `e`. This setup assumes that the signals `total` and `e` are inputs from the environment which are handled by the TSL system. Here is how you can define these predicates in a TSL format:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Define predicates related to the 'total' value comparisons
  isLessThanPoint75(total) <-> (total < 0.75);
  isLessThanOne(total) <-> (total < 1);
  isLessThanOnePoint25(total) <-> (total < 1.25);

  // Define predicates related to user key presses, assuming 'e' holds the key press data
  pressD(e) <-> (e == 'd');
  pressQ(e) <-> (e == 'q');
  pressO(e) <-> (e == 'o');
  press1(e) <-> (e == '1');
  press2(e) <-> (e == '2');
  press3(e) <-> (e == '3');
  pressR(e) <-> (e == 'r');
}
```

### Explanation:
- Here we are assuming each function as an equivalence (`<->`) to a specific condition. This setup allows the TSL system to understand how to interpret each predicate based on the input values of `total` and `e`.
- Each predicate checks a specific condition:
  - `isLessThanPoint75(total)`, `isLessThanOne(total)`, and `isLessThanOnePoint25(total)` check if the `total` is less than the specified value.
  - `pressD(e)`, `pressQ(e)`, `pressO(e)`, `press1(e)`, `press2(e)`, `press3(e)`, and `pressR(e)` check if the value of `e` matches the corresponding key. Here, we assume `e` holds a character representing the key pressed by the user.

### Assumptions:
- The system correctly interprets each comparison and equality check.
- The `e` and `total` variables are appropriately updated by the system to reflect the current input conditions.

This TSL setup should allow handling and evaluating the predicates correctly based on the system's inputs, facilitating decision-making processes and reactions within the system based on these predicates.
