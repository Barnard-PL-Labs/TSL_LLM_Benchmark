Based on the given description of the system environment and the task requirements, you will not be implementing actual JavaScript functions but rather focusing on specifying how these predicates are represented in a TSL (Temporal Stream Logic) template. Hereâ€™s the TSL template format that captures the behavior of the predicates in terms of their relationships and constraints:

```tsl
always assume {
    // Define the predicates based on the conditions presented in the cell values
    isLessThanPoint75(total) <-> (total < 0.75);
    isLessThanOne(total) <-> (total < 1);
    isLessThanOnePoint25(total) <-> (total < 1.25);

    // Define the predicates based on the event cell 'e' for key presses
    pressD(e) <-> (e == 'd');
    pressQ(e) <-> (e == 'q');
    pressO(e) <-> (e == 'o');
    press1(e) <-> (e == '1');
    press2(e) <-> (e == '2');
    press3(e) <-> (e == '3');
    pressR(e) <-> (e == 'r');
}

always guarantee {
    // Assertions or guarantees about these predicates can be added here if required for the system's functioning
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions (`always assume` block):**
    - The predicates related to the `total` cell (`isLessThanPoint75`, `isLessThanOne`, and `isLessThanOnePoint25`) are defined by comparing the value of `total` against specific numerical thresholds (0.75, 1, and 1.25, respectively).
    - The predicates for key presses (`pressD(e)`, `pressQ(e)`, etc.) check if the `e` cell (which represents a key press event) matches specific characters corresponding to each key. Each predicate correlates with a specific key.

2. **Guarantees (`always guarantee` block):**
    - This section would typically specify the system's behaviors or guarantees based on the predicates defined in the assumptions block. Since no specific behaviors or guarantees are mentioned in the prompt, this section is left empty but can be used to add system-specific logic as needed.

This TSL representation assumes that the system is capable of evaluating these predicates based on the inputs from the `total` and `e` cells in each state of the system. If there were dynamic actions or reactions based on these predicates, those would be specified in the `always guarantee` block.
