To implement the given predicates using the JavaScript environment for a vending machine system, we need to create functions that check for certain conditions based on the input signals from the `total` and `e` cells. These predicates will be used to determine how the vending machine interacts with its users and handles different states. Here is a JavaScript implementation of all the required predicates:

```javascript
// Predicate to check if the total is less than 0.75
function isLessThanPoint75(total) {
    return total < 0.75;
}

// Predicate to check if the total is less than 1
function isLessThanOne(total) {
    return total < 1;
}

// Predicate to check if the total is less than 1.25
function isLessThanOnePoint25(total) {
    return total < 1.25;
}

// Predicate to check if 'd' key is pressed
function pressD(e) {
    return e === 'd';
}

// Predicate to check if 'q' key is pressed
function pressQ(e) {
    return e === 'q';
}

// Predicate to check if 'o' key is pressed
function pressO(e) {
    return e === 'o';
}

// Predicate to check if '1' key is pressed
function press1(e) {
    return e === '1';
}

// Predicate to check if '2' key is pressed
function press2(e) {
    return e === '2';
}

// Predicate to check if '3' key is pressed
function press3(e) {
    return e === '3';
}

// Predicate to check if 'r' key is pressed
function pressR(e) {
    return e === 'r';
}
```

These functions are straightforward: they take the relevant input from the vending machineâ€™s sensors or interface (`total` for monetary input and `e` for keypresses) and return a boolean indicating whether the defined condition is met.

These predicates can be plugged into the remainder of your system to control the logic of the vending machine, such as determining which products can be purchased based on the amount of money inserted, or handling specific user inputs from the keypad.
