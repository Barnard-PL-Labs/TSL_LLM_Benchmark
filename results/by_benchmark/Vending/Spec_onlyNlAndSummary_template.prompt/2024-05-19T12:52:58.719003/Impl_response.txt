To implement the predicates using Temporal Stream Logic (TSL) for the described system, we will define the desired behavior in terms of temporal conditions. These predicates will help control the logic of a vending machine where user interactions and total amount handling are important.

We will start by assuming there's a cell "total" and an event "e" that capture the current amount in the machine and the key pressed by the user, respectively. Here's how the TSL template might look to incorporate these predicates:

```tsl
always assume {
    // Definitions for total-related predicates
    isLessThanPoint75(total) -> (total < 0.75);
    isLessThanOne(total) -> (total < 1);
    isLessThanOnePoint25(total) -> (total < 1.25);

    // Definitions for key press predicates given the 'e' event
    pressD(e) -> (e == 'd');
    pressQ(e) -> (e == 'q');
    pressO(e) -> (e == 'o');
    press1(e) -> (e == '1');
    press2(e) -> (e == '2');
    press3(e) -> (e == '3');
    pressR(e) -> (e == 'r');
}
always guarantee {
    // Possible implementations for actions based on predicates could be added here
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Predicates for `total`**:
   - `isLessThanPoint75(total)`: This is true if the value of `total` is less than 0.75.
   - `isLessThanOne(total)`: This is true if the value of `total` is less than 1.
   - `isLessThanOnePoint25(total)`: This is true if the value of `total` is less than 1.25.

2. **Key press predicates for `e`**:
   - Each key press function checks if the event `e` matches a specific character that represents a key on a keyboard. For example, `pressD(e)` checks if `e` equals 'd', meaning the 'd' key was pressed.

This framework provides a flexible approach to defining behavior in a vending machine system, where actions can be controlled based on the amount of money inserted and specific keys pressed by the user.

The `always assume` block sets the conditions under which the vending machine operates, which are based on the input cells and events. The `always guarantee` block, which is not detailed here, could be used to specify actions that should occur when the conditions in the `always assume` block are met, such as dispensing items, returning change, etc.
