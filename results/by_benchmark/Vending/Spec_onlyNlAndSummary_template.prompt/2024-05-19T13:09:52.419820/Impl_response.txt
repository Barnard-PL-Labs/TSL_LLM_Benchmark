To implement the predicates using JavaScript for the described vending machine environment, we can assume that `total` is a numerical variable that represents the total amount entered into the vending machine and `e` is an event object typically obtained from user interactions like key presses. The predicates you've asked for involve checking specific conditions based on these inputs. Here's how you could implement these predicates in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Predicates for checking the total amount
function isLessThanPoint75(total) {
    return total < 0.75;
}

function isLessThanOne(total) {
    return total < 1.0;
}

function isLessThanOnePoint25(total) {
    return total < 1.25;
}

// Predicates for checking key presses based on event 'e'
function pressD(e) {
    return e.key === 'd' || e.key === 'D';
}

function pressQ(e) {
    return e.key === 'q' || e.key === 'Q';
}

function pressO(e) {
    return e.key === 'o' || e.key === 'O';
}

function press1(e) {
    return e.key === '1';
}

function press2(e) {
    return e.key === '2';
}

function press3(e) {
    return e.key === '3';
}

function pressR(e) {
    return e.key === 'r' || e.key === 'R';
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Numerical Comparisons**: Functions like `isLessThanPoint75`, `isLessThanOne`, and `isLessThanOnePoint25` directly compare the `total` against specific numerical thresholds.
2. **Key Press Checks**: Functions like `pressD`, `pressQ`, etc., check the `key` property of the event object `e` to determine if a specific key was pressed. The checks accommodate both lowercase and uppercase inputs using logical OR (`||`) to compare with both cases.

These functions are designed to be used as such:
- **Numerical Predicates** can be used to control the flow of vending machine operations based on the amount of money inserted.
- **Key Press Predicates** can be used to respond to user inputs (like selecting an item or performing an action) in an event listener that handles key press events.

Usage in an event listener could look like this:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
    if (pressD(event)) {
        console.log("D key pressed");
        // handle D key action here
    }
    if (isLessThanOne(total)) {
        console.log("Total is less than $1");
        // handle condition here
    }
});
```

This setup assumes that `total` is globally accessible or otherwise passed to where it needs to be evaluated, and that `event` objects are correctly captured by event listeners in your system.
