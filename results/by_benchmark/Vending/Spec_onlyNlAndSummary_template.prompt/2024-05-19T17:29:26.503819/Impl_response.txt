To implement the predicates you've described in TSL for a vending machine system, we need to define the conditions that evaluate to true based on the provided cell states of "total" and "e". Below is the TSL template that corresponds to your requirements:

```tsl
always assume {
    // Assuming the necessary conditions for the system's operation
}

always guarantee {
    // Define predicates to check if 'total' is less than specific amounts
    isLessThanPoint75(total) : (total < 0.75);
    isLessThanOne(total) : (total < 1);
    isLessThanOnePoint25(total) : (total < 1.25);

    // Define predicates to check if specific keys are pressed in 'e'
    pressD(e) : (e == 'd');
    pressQ(e) : (e == 'q');
    pressO(e) : (e == 'o');
    press1(e) : (e == '1');
    press2(e) : (e == '2');
    press3(e) : (e == '3');
    pressR(e) : (e == 'r');
}
```

This TSL template assumes that the variable `total` represents a numeric value denoting the total amount available or inserted by the user, and `e` represents the key that has been pressed. The predicates `isLessThanPoint75`, `isLessThanOne`, and `isLessThanOnePoint25` check the conditions against `total`, while `pressD`, `pressQ`, `pressO`, `press1`, `press2`, `press3`, and `pressR` check if specific keys are pressed in `e`.

This design helps in making decisions based on the state of the inputs, such as enabling specific functions of the vending machine or handling user interactions via key presses. There are no actual functions implemented as per your request; only predicates are defined to evaluate the conditions mentioned.
