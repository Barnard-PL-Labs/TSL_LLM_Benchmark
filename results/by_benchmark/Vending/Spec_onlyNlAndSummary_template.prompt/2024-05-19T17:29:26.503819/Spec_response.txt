Here's a TSL specification based on the natural language description you've provided about the user interaction with a vending machine:

```tsl
always assume {
  // mutual exclusion for all button inputs
  !(pressD && pressQ) && !(pressD && pressO) && !(pressD && press1) && !(pressD && press2) && !(pressD && press3) && !(pressD && pressR) &&
  !(pressQ && pressO) && !(pressQ && press1) && !(pressQ && press2) && !(pressQ && press3) && !(pressQ && pressR) &&
  !(pressO && press1) && !(pressO && press2) && !(pressO && press3) && !(pressO && pressR) &&
  !(press1 && press2) && !(press1 && press3) && !(press1 && pressR) &&
  !(press2 && press3) && !(press2 && pressR) &&
  !(press3 && pressR);
}

always guarantee {
  // increment the total value when coins and bills are inserted
  pressD -> [total <- total + 0.1];
  pressQ -> [total <- total + 0.25];
  pressO -> [total <- total + 1];

  // decrement the total value when products are purchased, ensuring sufficient funds are available
  press1 && !isLessThanPoint75(total) -> [total <- total - 0.75];
  press2 && !isLessThanOne(total) -> [total <- total - 1];
  press3 && !isLessThanOnePoint25(total) -> [total <- total - 1.25];

  // refund the money
  pressR -> [total <- 0];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions:** We assume mutual exclusion for button presses, meaning each button press is handled independently without overlap. This is critical in avoiding function conflicts or multiple deductions/additions at the same time.

2. **Guarantees:** 
   - Coins and bills insertion (`pressD`, `pressQ`, `pressO`) increases the `total` by their respective amounts.
   - Product purchases (`press1`, `press2`, `press3`) decrease the `total` only if there are sufficient funds, which is checked using the given functions (`isLessThanPoint75`, `isLessThanOne`, `isLessThanOnePoint25`). The logical negation (`!`) is used because the function names suggest that they return true when the total is less than the specified amount, hence the negation checks for the opposite (greater than or equal).
   - Resetting the total value to zero on refund (`pressR`). 

This specification ensures that the vending machine operates correctly according to the user's actions and the system's rules.
