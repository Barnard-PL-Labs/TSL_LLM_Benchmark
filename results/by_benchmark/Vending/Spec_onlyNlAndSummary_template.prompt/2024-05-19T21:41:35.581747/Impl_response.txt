To implement the predicates as specified using TSL (Temporal Stream Logic), you'll need to define the conditions for the predicates based on the input from the cells "total" and "e". The predicates should determine the behavior of the vending machine based on these inputs. Below is the TSL translation for the system described:

```tsl
always assume {
    // Define predicates for total
    isLessThanPoint75(total) -> (total < 0.75);
    isLessThanOne(total) -> (total < 1);
    isLessThanOnePoint25(total) -> (total < 1.25);
    
    // Define predicates for e (key presses)
    pressD(e) -> (e == 'd');
    pressQ(e) -> (e == 'q');
    pressO(e) -> (e == 'o');
    press1(e) -> (e == '1');
    press2(e) -> (e == '2');
    press3(e) -> (e == '3');
    pressR(e) -> (e == 'r');
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Predicates for 'total'**:
    - `isLessThanPoint75(total)`: This predicate checks if the value of "total" is less than 0.75. It's expressed in TSL as `total < 0.75`.
    - `isLessThanOne(total)`: This predicate checks if the value of "total" is less than 1. It's expressed as `total < 1`.
    - `isLessThanOnePoint25(total)`: This predicate checks if the value of "total" is less than 1.25. It's expressed as `total < 1.25`.

2. **Predicates for 'e' (key presses)**:
    - Each predicate related to key presses maps directly to a comparison of the value of "e" with a specific character representing the key. If "e" matches the character for the specified key, the predicate returns true.

This setup allows the vending machine system to react dynamically based on the inputs specified by the cells "total" and "e". Each predicate is defined in a straightforward manner to ensure clear and predictable logic for deciding the vending machine's behavior.
