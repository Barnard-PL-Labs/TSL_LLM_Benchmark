To implement the predicates specified in the scenario using TSL (Temporal Stream Logic), we need to define the conditions that check the values of the cells `total` and `e` according to the requirements. These predicates will be part of the system's assumptions about its environment.

Here's how you would define these predicates in a TSL template:

```tsl
always assume {
    // Predicates for "total"
    isLessThanPoint75(total) := total < 0.75;
    isLessThanOne(total) := total < 1;
    isLessThanOnePoint25(total) := total < 1.25;

    // Predicates for "e" based on key presses
    pressD(e) := e == 'd';
    pressQ(e) := e == 'q';
    pressO(e) := e == 'o';
    press1(e) := e == '1';
    press2(e) := e == '2';
    press3(e) := e == '3';
    pressR(e) := e == 'r';
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Predicates for "total"**: These check if the value in the `total` cell is less than specified amounts (0.75, 1, and 1.25). The operators used (`<`) directly evaluate the conditions based on the current value of `total`.

2. **Predicates for "e"**: These determine if a specific key was pressed. Since `e` holds the current key state, the conditions check if `e` equals a particular character representing a key ('d', 'q', 'o', '1', '2', '3', 'r'). Each predicate corresponds to a different key press.

This setup in TSL allows you to define how the system should assume the behavior of its environment based on the inputs from the cells `total` and `e`. These assumptions are crucial for designing the guarantees or actions the system must uphold or perform in response to these conditions.
