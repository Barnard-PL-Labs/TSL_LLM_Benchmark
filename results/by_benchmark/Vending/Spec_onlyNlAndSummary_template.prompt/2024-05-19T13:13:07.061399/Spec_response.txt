Here is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure mutual exclusion between all buttons
  !(pressD && pressQ);
  !(pressD && pressO);
  !(pressD && press1);
  !(pressD && press2);
  !(pressD && press3);
  !(pressD && pressR);
  !(pressQ && pressO);
  !(pressQ && press1);
  !(pressQ && press2);
  !(pressQ && press3);
  !(pressQ && pressR);
  !(pressO && press1);
  !(pressO && press2);
  !(pressO && press3);
  !(pressO && pressR);
  !(press1 && press2);
  !(press1 && press3);
  !(press1 && pressR);
  !(press2 && press3);
  !(press2 && pressR);
  !(press3 && pressR);
}

always guarantee {
  // When 'pressD' is pressed, increment the total by 0.1
  pressD -> [total <- total + 0.1];

  // When 'pressQ' is pressed, increment the total by 0.25
  pressQ -> [total <- total + 0.25];

  // When 'pressO' is pressed, increment the total by 1
  pressO -> [total <- total + 1];

  // When 'press1' is pressed and total is at least 0.75, decrement the total by 0.75
  (press1 && total >= 0.75) -> [total <- total - 0.75];

  // When 'press2' is pressed and total is at least 1, decrement the total by 1
  (press2 && total >= 1) -> [total <- total - 1];

  // When 'press3' is pressed and total is at least 1.25, decrement the total by 1.25
  (press3 && total >= 1.25) -> [total <- total - 1.25];

  // When 'pressR' is pressed, set the total to 0
  pressR -> [total <- 0];
}
```

This TSL specification sets up a system where pressing buttons on a vending machine affects the total amount of money entered, ensuring that no two operations occur simultaneously, using mutual exclusion logic in the assumptions and updating the state based on button presses in the guarantees. Each guarantee action is triggered only when the corresponding button is pressed, and for purchasing actions, only if the total is sufficient.
