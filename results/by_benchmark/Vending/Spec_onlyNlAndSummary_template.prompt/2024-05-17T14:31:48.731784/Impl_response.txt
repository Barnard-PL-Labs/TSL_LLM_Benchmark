To define the predicates in Temporal Stream Logic (TSL) based on the given description, you need to create logical expressions that evaluate to true or false based on the cells' states. Here's how you could define these predicates:

```tsl
always assume {
    // Define predicates related to the `total` cell's state.
    isLessThanPoint75(total) -> (total < 0.75);
    isLessThanOne(total) -> (total < 1);
    isLessThanOnePoint25(total) -> (total < 1.25);

    // Define predicates related to the `e` cell's state and key presses.
    pressD(e) -> (e == 'd');
    pressQ(e) -> (e == 'q');
    pressO(e) -> (e == 'o');
    press1(e) -> (e == '1');
    press2(e) -> (e == '2');
    press3(e) -> (e == '3');
    pressR(e) -> (e == 'r');
}

always guarantee {
    // Place here any system guarantees based on the predicates defined in `always assume`.
}
```

In this TSL template, the `always assume` block contains definitions for the predicates based on the provided descriptions:

1. **Total Checks**:
   - `isLessThanPoint75(total)` checks if the value in the `total` cell is less than 0.75.
   - `isLessThanOne(total)` checks if it's less than 1.
   - `isLessThanOnePoint25(total)` checks if it's less than 1.25.

2. **Key Press Checks**:
   - Each `pressX(e)` predicate checks if the key represented by 'X' (e.g., 'd', 'q', 'o', '1', '2', '3', 'r') is the current value of the cell `e`.

These definitions leverage the simplicity of logical expressions in TSL to directly relate the predicates to the states of `total` and `e`. The `always guarantee` block is left empty as no specific behavior or response to these predicates is detailed in the prompt, but this is where you would normally specify how the system should react based on the evaluated predicates.
