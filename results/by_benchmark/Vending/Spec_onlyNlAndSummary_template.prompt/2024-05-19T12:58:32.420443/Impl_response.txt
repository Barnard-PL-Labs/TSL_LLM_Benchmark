To design the predicates for the vending machine in Temporal Stream Logic (TSL), we can follow the description provided, translating each predicate into its logical representation. Here, the predicates reflect specific conditions that can change over time and are evaluated based on the system's inputs and state.

Let's write down the TSL predicates using the appropriate syntax:

### TSL Template

```tsl
always assume {
    // Predicates related to the 'total' cell
    isLessThanPoint75(total) <=> total < 0.75;
    isLessThanOne(total) <=> total < 1;
    isLessThanOnePoint25(total) <=> total < 1.25;

    // Predicates related to the 'e' cell for key press detections
    pressD(e) <=> e == 'd';
    pressQ(e) <=> e == 'q';
    pressO(e) <=> e == 'o';
    press1(e) <=> e == '1';
    press2(e) <=> e == '2';
    press3(e) <=> e == '3';
    pressR(e) <=> e == 'r';
}
always guarantee {
    // Define the system's response based on the predicates
    // Behavior specifications can be added here if needed
}
```

### Explanation

In the TSL template:
- `always assume` block captures the environmental inputs that are continually evaluated based on the current state or inputs.
- Each predicate uses `<=>` (if and only if) to define an exact condition. For instance, `isLessThanPoint75(total) <=> total < 0.75;` means that the predicate `isLessThanPoint75(total)` is true if and only if the value of `total` is less than 0.75.
- `always guarantee` block would encapsulate responses or actions the system should guarantee based on the assumptions. This area is left empty for now as the specific behaviors or outputs are not defined in the prompt.

This structured TSL representation allows the vending machine system to interpret and react to changes in its environment predictably and consistently according to the defined predicates.
