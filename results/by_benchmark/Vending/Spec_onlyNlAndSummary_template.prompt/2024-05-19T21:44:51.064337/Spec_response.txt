Below is the TSL specification derived from the natural language description for the vending machine operations:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Define mutual exclusion between button presses
  !(pressD && (pressQ || pressO || press1 || press2 || press3 || pressR));
  !(pressQ && (pressD || pressO || press1 || press2 || press3 || pressR));
  !(pressO && (pressD || pressQ || press1 || press2 || press3 || pressR));
  !(press1 && (pressD || pressQ || pressO || press2 || press3 || pressR));
  !(press2 && (pressD || pressQ || pressO || press1 || press3 || pressR));
  !(press3 && (pressD || pressQ || pressO || press1 || press2 || pressR));
  !(pressR && (pressD || pressQ || pressO || press1 || press2 || press3));
}

always guarantee {
  // Increment the vending machine's value by 0.1 when pressD is pushed
  pressD -> [total <- total + 0.1];

  // Increment the vending machine's value by 0.25 when pressQ is pushed
  pressQ -> [total <- total + 0.25];

  // Increment the vending machine's value by 1 when pressO is pushed
  pressO -> [total <- total + 1];

  // Decrement the vending machine's value by 0.75 when press1 is pushed
  // and the total is >= 0.75
  press1 && !isLessThanPoint75(total) -> [total <- total - 0.75];

  // Decrement the vending machine's value by 1 when press2 is pushed
  // and the total is >= 1
  press2 && !isLessThanOne(total) -> [total <- total - 1];

  // Decrement the vending machine's value by 1.25 when press3 is pushed
  // and the total is >= 1.25
  press3 && !isLessThanOnePoint25(total) -> [total <- total - 1.25];

  // Set the vending machine's value to zero when pressR is pushed
  pressR -> [total <- 0];
}
```

This TSL code assumes mutual exclusion between all button presses, ensuring no two operations can happen simultaneously. It then describes how each button press affects the total amount in the vending machine, with conditions for decrementing the total based on the current value in the machine, and resetting the total with a specific button press.
