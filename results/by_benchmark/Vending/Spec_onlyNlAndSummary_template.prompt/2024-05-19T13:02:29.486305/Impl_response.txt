In Temporal Stream Logic (TSL), you typically express system constraints and behaviors rather than implementing explicit function definitions like in imperative programming languages such as JavaScript. For the vending machine scenario described, we can define the predicates directly within the TSL framework's assumptions and guarantees. Below, I'll translate the given predicates into TSL expressions suited for a hypothetical TSL-based specification of the vending machine system.

### TSL Template Structure
```tsl
always assume {
    // Assumptions about the environment or inputs
}

always guarantee {
    // Guarantees about system reactions
}
```

### Translating Predicates into TSL Expressions

#### Predicate Definitions:
- `isLessThanPoint75(total)`: Checks if the total is less than $0.75.
- `isLessThanOne(total)`: Checks if the total is less than $1.
- `isLessThanOnePoint25(total)`: Checks if the total is less than $1.25.
- `pressD(e)`: Checks if the 'D' key is pressed.
- `pressQ(e)`: Checks if the 'Q' key is pressed.
- `pressO(e)`: Checks if the 'O' key is pressed.
- `press1(e)`: Checks if the '1' key is pressed.
- `press2(e)`: Checks if the '2' key is pressed.
- `press3(e)`: Checks if the '3' key is pressed.
- `pressR(e)`: Checks if the 'R' key is pressed.

#### TSL Implementation

```tsl
always assume {
    // Define predicates based on the 'total' cell
    (total < 0.75) <-> isLessThanPoint75;
    (total < 1) <-> isLessThanOne;
    (total < 1.25) <-> isLessThanOnePoint25;

    // Define predicates based on the 'e' cell (button press events)
    (e == 'D') <-> pressD;
    (e == 'Q') <-> pressQ;
    (e == 'O') <-> pressO;
    (e == '1') <-> press1;
    (e == '2') <-> press2;
    (e == '3') <-> press3;
    (e == 'R') <-> pressR;
}

always guarantee {
    // System's reaction can be defined here based on the predicates
    // Examples:
    pressD -> someAction();  // Define what happens when D is pressed
    isLessThanPoint75 -> displayMessage("Add more coins");  // Display message when the total is less than 0.75
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Assumptions**: Here, we map the real-world conditions (like checking if `total` is less than a certain amount or if a specific key is pressed) to the predicates. Each mapping is bidirectional (`<->`) which means that the predicate is true if and only if the condition is true.
  
- **Guarantees**: Based on the predicates, we can specify how the system should respond. For example, when `pressD` is true (i.e., the 'D' key is pressed), the system could trigger a specific action (like dispensing a product or displaying a message).

This TSL framework represents a conceptual level specification, which guides the behavior of the vending machine in response to various inputs and conditions.
