Here is the TSL specification reflecting the natural language description provided:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Mutual exclusion for button presses
  !(pressD && (pressQ || pressO || press1 || press2 || press3 || pressR));
  !(pressQ && (pressD || pressO || press1 || press2 || press3 || pressR));
  !(pressO && (pressD || pressQ || press1 || press2 || press3 || pressR));
  !(press1 && (pressD || pressQ || pressO || press2 || press3 || pressR));
  !(press2 && (pressD || pressQ || pressO || press1 || press3 || pressR));
  !(press3 && (pressD || pressQ || pressO || press1 || press2 || pressR));
  !(pressR && (pressD || pressQ || pressO || press1 || press2 || press3));
}

always guarantee {
  // Increment total by 0.1 when pressD is pressed
  pressD -> [total <- total + 0.1];
  
  // Increment total by 0.25 when pressQ is pressed
  pressQ -> [total <- total + 0.25];

  // Increment total by 1 when pressO is pressed
  pressO -> [total <- total + 1];

  // Decrement total by 0.75 when press1 is pressed, if total is at least 0.75
  press1 && total >= 0.75 -> [total <- total - 0.75];

  // Decrement total by 1 when press2 is pressed, if total is at least 1
  press2 && total >= 1 -> [total <- total - 1];

  // Decrement total by 1.25 when press3 is pressed, if total is at least 1.25
  press3 && total >= 1.25 -> [total <- total - 1.25];

  // Set total to 0 when pressR is pressed
  pressR -> [total <- 0];
}
```

This TSL specification captures the behavior of the vending machine controlled by multiple button presses, ensuring that actions such as adding money to the machine or purchasing products alter the `total` variable appropriately. It also includes mutual exclusion for button presses to prevent simultaneous operations, maintaining the integrity and correctness of the system's state.
