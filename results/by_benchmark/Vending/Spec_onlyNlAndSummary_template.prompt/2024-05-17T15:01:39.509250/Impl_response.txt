Here's how you can implement the predicates in TSL (Temporal Stream-based Specification Language) for the given vending machine system scenario:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Define the inputs and their exclusive interactions if needed
  !(pressD(e) && pressQ(e));
  !(pressD(e) && pressO(e));
  !(pressD(e) && press1(e));
  !(pressD(e) && press2(e));
  !(pressD(e) && press3(e));
  !(pressD(e) && pressR(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && pressO(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && press1(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && press2(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && press3(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && pressR(e));
  !(pressO(e) && press1(e));
  !(pressO(e) && press2(e));
  !(pressO(e) && press3(e));
  !(pressO(e) && pressR(e));
  !(press1(e) && press2(e));
  !(press1(e) && press3(e));
  !(press1(e) && pressR(e));
  !(press2(e) && press3(e));
  !(press2(e) && pressR(e));
  !(press3(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Define the behavior of the system based on the inputs
  isLessThanPoint75(total) -> [total < 0.75];
  isLessThanOne(total) -> [total < 1];
  isLessThanOnePoint25(total) -> [total < 1.25];
  pressD(e) -> [e == 'D'];
  pressQ(e) -> [e == 'Q'];
  pressO(e) -> [e == 'O'];
  press1(e) -> [e == '1'];
  press2(e) -> [e == '2'];
  press3(e) -> [e == '3'];
  pressR(e) -> [e == 'R'];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions Section (`always assume`)**: 
   - This section is used to define mutual exclusivity among the button presses. This prevents unrealistic scenarios where two or more buttons are claimed to be pressed simultaneously. 

2. **Guarantees Section (`always guarantee`)**:
   - **Predicates for Totals**: These predicates check if the `total` value is less than specific amounts (0.75, 1, and 1.25), crucial for determining what actions the vending machine can perform based on the money inserted.
   - **Button Press Predicates**: These predicates check if a specific button (identified by characters 'D', 'Q', 'O', '1', '2', '3', 'R') is pressed. Each predicate corresponds to a different action or input in the system.

This TSL framework ensures the system's behavior is clearly specified in reaction to user inputs and system states, which can be critical in settings like vending machines where input handling and state management are key to correct operation.
