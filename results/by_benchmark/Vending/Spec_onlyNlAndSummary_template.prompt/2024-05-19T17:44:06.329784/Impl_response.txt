To implement the predicates described using TSL (Temporal Stream Logic), you would define the conditions and behaviors that these predicates should satisfy in the system's `always assume` and `always guarantee` blocks. Since you're focusing solely on predicates and not actions, the `always guarantee` block isn't necessary unless you are describing how the system reacts to these predicates. Below is a TSL template for defining these predicates within an `always assume` block.

```tsl
always assume {
  // Predicates for the 'total' cell comparing various thresholds
  isLessThanPoint75(total) := (total < 0.75);
  isLessThanOne(total) := (total < 1);
  isLessThanOnePoint25(total) := (total < 1.25);

  // Predicates for the 'e' cell handling key presses
  pressD(e) := (e == 'd');
  pressQ(e) := (e == 'q');
  pressO(e) := (e == 'o');
  press1(e) := (e == '1');
  press2(e) := (e == '2');
  press3(e) := (e == '3');
  pressR(e) := (e == 'r');
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Predicates for `total`:** These predicates check if the value of `total` is less than certain amounts (0.75, 1, and 1.25). They are defined using simple comparison operators.

2. **Predicates for `e`:** These predicates determine which key is pressed and are defined by comparing the value of `e` to specific characters, which represent key presses.

This TSL template assumes that the TSL system has access to the values of `total` and `e` and that it can evaluate these predicates based on their current values. This setup allows other parts of the system to use these predicates to make decisions or trigger other actions.
