To translate the specified predicates into TSL (Temporal Stream Logic) template format, we will define the predicates as conditions within the `always assume` block of a TSL template. Since we are only focused on creating predicates, the `always guarantee` block will be minimal or not defined, as it depends on how the predicates are used within the system implementation. Here, we assume no specific actions are required to be guaranteed based on these predicates.

Here's how this can be structured in TSL:

```tsl
always assume {
    // Predicate to check if total is less than 0.75
    isLessThanPoint75(total) <-> (total < 0.75);

    // Predicate to check if total is less than 1
    isLessThanOne(total) <-> (total < 1);

    // Predicate to check if total is less than 1.25
    isLessThanOnePoint25(total) <-> (total < 1.25);

    // Predicates to check for specific key presses in e
    pressD(e) <-> (e == 'd');
    pressQ(e) <-> (e == 'q');
    pressO(e) <-> (e == 'o');
    press1(e) <-> (e == '1');
    press2(e) <-> (e == '2');
    press3(e) <-> (e == '3');
    pressR(e) <-> (e == 'r');
}

always guarantee {
    // In this case, no specific actions are defined to be always guaranteed.
    // This block could be populated based on the system's requirements dealing with the predicates.
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each `predicate` is defined using a bi-directional implication (`<->`), where the left-hand side of the implication is the predicate function name and the right-hand side describes the logical condition that evaluates to `true` or `false`.
- The conditions use basic comparison operators and equality checks, as specified by the API description.
- In this example, the `always guarantee` block has been left empty because no actions are specified that should always occur based on these predicates. In a real-world implementation, this section might contain templated actions that should occur based on the state described by the predicates.

This TSL template sets up the conditions that might be used in a vending machine context to determine operational readiness or to respond to user inputs, but it does not specify any control logic or actions that depend on such conditions.
