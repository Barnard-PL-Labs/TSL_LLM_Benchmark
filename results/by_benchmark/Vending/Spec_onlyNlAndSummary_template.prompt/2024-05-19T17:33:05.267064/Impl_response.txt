To implement the predicates specified in the requirements, we leverage the given API directly within a TSL template. Since no functions are allowed, the implementation will involve directly verifying the conditions using TSL predicates. The challenge here is that we aren't directly implementing these in JavaScript, but rather describing them within a TSL format as assumptions and guarantees about how the system should behave based on the states of `total` and `e`. Here's how you could structure the TSL template:

```TSL
always assume {
  // Assume definitions for how the predicates interact with the inputs.
  pressD(e) <-> (e == 'd');
  pressQ(e) <-> (e == 'q');
  pressO(e) <-> (e == 'o');
  press1(e) <-> (e == '1');
  press2(e) <-> (e == '2');
  press3(e) <-> (e == '3');
  pressR(e) <-> (e == 'r');
}

always guarantee {
  // Guarantee that these predicates correctly interpret the total value
  isLessThanPoint75(total) <-> total < 0.75;
  isLessThanOne(total) <-> total < 1.0;
  isLessThanOnePoint25(total) <-> total < 1.25;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **always assume**: Here, we define how the predicates related to button presses are linked to the variable `e`. We do this by using a bi-directional implication (`<->`), which implies that pressing a specific key (like 'd', 'q', 'o', etc.) is represented by `e` being equal to that character.
  
- **always guarantee**: This section defines the behavior or the condition checks related to the `total` amount in the vending machine. We create predicates for checking if `total` is less than specific amounts (0.75, 1.0, and 1.25). These predicates are expressed as bi-directional implications, asserting the relationship between the predicate and the condition on the `total`.

This TSL snippet establishes a framework within which the system should behave. It encapsulates the logic for how inputs (`e` and `total`) are interpreted by the system, ensuring that the specified predicates, when invoked, will correctly reflect the state of the system based on the inputs received.
