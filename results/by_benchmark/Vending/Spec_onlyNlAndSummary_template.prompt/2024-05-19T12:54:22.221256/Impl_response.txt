To implement the predicates described in the requirements using Temporal Stream Logic (TSL), we'll define the predicates directly in TSL format. Since we are not implementing actual JavaScript functions but rather defining predicates for a theoretical vending machine system, our TSL template will focus on expressing conditions involving cell states and inputs.

Here is how we can define the predicates in TSL:

```tsl
always assume {
    // Definitions for the button press predicates related to cell "e"
    pressD(e) <-> (e == 'd');
    pressQ(e) <-> (e == 'q');
    pressO(e) <-> (e == 'o');
    press1(e) <-> (e == '1');
    press2(e) <-> (e == '2');
    press3(e) <-> (e == '3');
    pressR(e) <-> (e == 'r');
    
    // Definitions for the money total comparison predicates related to cell "total"
    isLessThanPoint75(total) <-> (total < 0.75);
    isLessThanOne(total) <-> (total < 1.0);
    isLessThanOnePoint25(total) <-> (total < 1.25);
}

always guarantee {
    // The guarantee block would contain system behaviors or state transitions based on the predicates
    // For example, handling the insertion of money or a button press.
    // This is where the behavior of the vending machine in response to the predicates would be defined.
}
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Predicates for Press Events:** Each button press predicate `pressX(e)` checks if the cell `e` (which represents the current button press) matches a specific character that represents the button. For example, `pressD(e)` checks if `e` is 'd', which means the 'd' key was pressed. This is modeled by an equivalence (`<->`) in TSL, stating that `pressD(e)` is true if and only if `e` equals 'd'.

2. **Predicates for Money Total Comparisons:** Each predicate related to the `total` cell checks if the `total` is less than a specific value. For instance, `isLessThanPoint75(total)` checks if `total` is less than 0.75. Again, we use equivalence in TSL to state that this predicate is true if and only if the `total` is less than 0.75.

3. **Assumptions and Guarantees:** In TSL, the `always assume` block is used to define the environment or external conditions, which in this case are the states of `e` and `total`. The `always guarantee` block is where you would define how the system should behave based on these conditions. This could involve transitioning system states, activating features of the vending machine, or other actions based on the input predicates.

This TSL template lays out the logical structure and conditions under which the vending machine operates, based on the defined predicates. More detailed behavior (inside the `always guarantee` block) would depend on the specific requirements and functionalities expected from the vending machine system.
