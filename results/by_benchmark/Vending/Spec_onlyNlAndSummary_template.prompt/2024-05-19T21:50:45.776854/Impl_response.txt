To implement the predicates described using TSL (Temporal Stream Logic), we need to define them in a way that reflects their usage in a system that monitors and reacts to changes in the state of a vending machine. Here's how you can define the predicates using TSL in a structured "always assume" or "always guarantee" block:

```tsl
always assume {
    // Cell total represents the state of the signal for vending machine tasks
    // Cell e represents the state of the signal for vending machine actions

    // Predicates for checking if the total is less than certain amounts
    isLessThanPoint75(total) -> (total < 0.75);
    isLessThanOne(total) -> (total < 1);
    isLessThanOnePoint25(total) -> (total < 1.25);

    // Predicates for checking key presses from cell e
    pressD(e) -> (e == 'd');
    pressQ(e) -> (e == 'q');
    pressO(e) -> (e == 'o');
    press1(e) -> (e == '1');
    press2(e) -> (e == '2');
    press3(e) -> (e == '3');
    pressR(e) -> (e == 'r');
}

always guarantee {
    // Depending on the system requirements, implement how the system should react to these predicates
    // This section should be filled accordingly with system-specific logic.
}
```

In this TSL template:

1. **always assume**: Defines the conditions or predicates that are assumed to be true based on the inputs from the environment (`total` and `e`).
2. **always guarantee**: Should define the actions or guarantees the system should maintain based on the predicates defined in the assumptions. This will depend on what you need the vending machine system to perform and has been left blank as it needs to be filled in with specific system response logic.

The predicates are defined using simple logical comparisons and checks against specific values. These predicates can be used in the "always guarantee" section to specify how the system should behave when these conditions are met. For example, if the total is less than 0.75, the vending machine might disable certain options that require at least 0.75. Similarly, key presses could trigger different actions or changes in the vending machine's state.
