To implement the predicates using the given system environment, we can directly define conditional checks corresponding to each predicate function. Since the `total` and `e` are described as cells representing certain states, we cannot directly implement JavaScript functions. Instead, I will write these predicates in a Temporal Stream Logic (TSL) template that represents the logic required.

## TSL Template for the predicates:

```tsl
always assume {
    // Assumptions about the input signals and their mutual exclusions if necessary

    // Define the mutual exclusions for key presses
    !(pressD(e) && pressQ(e));
    !(pressD(e) && pressO(e));
    !(pressD(e) && press1(e));
    !(pressD(e) && press2(e));
    !(pressD(e) && press3(e));
    !(pressD(e) && pressR(e));
    !(pressQ(e) && pressO(e));
    !(pressQ(e) && press1(e));
    !(pressQ(e) && press2(e));
    !(pressQ(e) && press3(e));
    !(pressQ(e) && pressR(e));
    !(pressO(e) && press1(e));
    !(pressO(e) && press2(e));
    !(pressO(e) && press3(e));
    !(pressO(e) && pressR(e));
    !(press1(e) && press2(e));
    !(press1(e) && press3(e));
    !(press1(e) && pressR(e));
    !(press2(e) && press3(e));
    !(press2(e) && pressR(e));
    !(press3(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
    // Predicates for checking the total

    // is the total less than 0.75?
    isLessThanPoint75(total);  // Represented as: total < 0.75

    // is the total less than 1?
    isLessThanOne(total);  // Represented as: total < 1

    // is the total less than 1.25?
    isLessThanOnePoint25(total);  // Represented as: total < 1.25

    // Predicates for key presses

    // did the user press the d key?
    pressD(e);  // This could be an event listener or input check for 'd'

    // did the user press the q key?
    pressQ(e);  // Similarly, this checks for 'q'

    // did the user press the o key?
    pressO(e);  // Checking for 'o'

    // did the user press the 1 key?
    press1(e);  // Event check for '1'

    // did the user press the 2 key?
    press2(e);  // And '2'

    // did the user press the 3 key?
    press3(e);  // And '3'

    // did the user press the r key?
    pressR(e);  // Lastly, for 'r'
}
```

### Explanation:
- **always assume**: Here, we define assumptions about the inputs. Specifically, we ensure that no two key press events can happen simultaneously, mimicking a "mutually exclusive" behavior for simplicity and clarity in the system's logic.
  
- **always guarantee**: Each predicate function is represented as a logical condition. We use placeholders like `total < 0.75` to represent the logic of `isLessThanPoint75(total)`, although in actual implementation this would need to interface directly with how `total` and `e` are defined and updated in your environment.

This TSL template sets up the necessary logic based on the description given, though adaptation to an actual system might require interfacing with specific APIs or libraries to manage states and events directly.
