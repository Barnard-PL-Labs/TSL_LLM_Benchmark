To implement the predicates using Temporal Stream Logic (TSL), you'll express the conditions and behaviors over time without using JavaScript functions, but rather by defining conditions directly in the TSL framework. Based on the requirements and the description provided, here's how you can define these predicates in a TSL template.

Given that the predicates are related to the state of certain variables (`total` and `e`), and how they relate to specific values or events (like pressing a key), the TSL template can be set up as follows:

### TSL Template for Vending Machine Predicates

```tsl
always assume {
    // Define the nature of the total and e cells assuming they are provided from the environment
}

always guarantee {
    // This section will detail how the system should behave based on the predicates.
    // Since no specific guarantee is needed for predicates alone, and without further context
    // on what to guarantee, this section could remain largely unspecified or used for future conditions.
}

// Define predicates as expressions in the TSL environment:
isLessThanPoint75(total) := total < 0.75;
isLessThanOne(total) := total < 1;
isLessThanOnePoint25(total) := total < 1.25;

pressD(e) := e == 'D';  // Assuming 'e' is a character representation of key presses
pressQ(e) := e == 'Q';
pressO(e) := e == 'O';
press1(e) := e == '1';
press2(e) := e == '2';
press3(e) := e == '3';
pressR(e) := e == 'R';
```

### Explanation:

1. **Assumptions**: The `always assume` block might be used to declare any assumptions about the input signals or environmental states that the system depends on. For instance, you might assume that `total` and `e` are updated correctly by the external environment.

2. **Guarantees**: The `always guarantee` block specifies how the system must respond to certain conditions. Since the task is to define predicates without implementing specific functions or actions, this block is minimally used. It could, however, be adapted to specify system responses or interactions based on the predicates in a more complete system setup.

3. **Predicates**: Each predicate is defined as a condition in TSL. These conditions check the value of `total` against specified thresholds or match the value of `e` to expected key presses. This directly translates the natural language descriptions into temporal conditions which can be used in broader system specifications.

Remember, TSL is used to specify the behavior over time, ensuring that system specifications meet certain temporal conditions or responses. In a real-world scenario, these predicates would be part of a larger TSL framework where the guarantees could involve reactions based on the state defined by these predicates.
