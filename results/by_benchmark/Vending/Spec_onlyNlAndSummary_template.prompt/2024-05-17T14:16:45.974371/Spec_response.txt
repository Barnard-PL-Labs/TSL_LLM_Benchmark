Here is the TSL specification that follows the natural language description provided:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure that no two operations can be performed at the same time
  !(pressD && pressQ) && !(pressD && pressO) && !(pressD && press1) && !(pressD && press2) && !(pressD && press3) && !(pressD && pressR) &&
  !(pressQ && pressO) && !(pressQ && press1) && !(pressQ && press2) && !(pressQ && press3) && !(pressQ && pressR) &&
  !(pressO && press1) && !(pressO && press2) && !(pressO && press3) && !(pressO && pressR) &&
  !(press1 && press2) && !(press1 && press3) && !(press1 && pressR) &&
  !(press2 && press3) && !(press2 && pressR) &&
  !(press3 && pressR);
}

always guarantee {
  // Increment the total by 0.1 when pressD is pushed
  pressD -> [total <- total + 0.1];

  // Increment the total by 0.25 when pressQ is pushed
  pressQ -> [total <- total + 0.25];

  // Increment the total by 1 when pressO is pushed
  pressO -> [total <- total + 1];

  // Decrement the total by 0.75 when press1 is pushed, if the total is 0.75 or greater
  press1 && total >= 0.75 -> [total <- total - 0.75];

  // Decrement the total by 1 when press2 is pushed, if the total is 1 or greater
  press2 && total >= 1 -> [total <- total - 1];

  // Decrement the total by 1.25 when press3 is pushed, if the total is 1.25 or greater
  press3 && total >= 1.25 -> [total <- total - 1.25];

  // Set the total to 0 when pressR is pushed
  pressR -> [total <- 0];
}
```

This TSL specification includes assumptions to ensure that no two operations can occur at the same time, reflecting the requirement that no two machine operations can be performed simultaneously. The guarantees section describes the actions taken upon pressing each button, in line with the rules specified in the natural language description.
