Based on the natural language description and the requirements outlined, here is the corresponding TSL specification:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Mutual exclusion: No two machine operations can be performed at the same time
  !(press1 && (press2 || press3 || pressD || pressQ || pressO || pressR));
  !(press2 && (press1 || press3 || pressD || pressQ || pressO || pressR));
  !(press3 && (press1 || press2 || pressD || pressQ || pressO || pressR));
  !(pressD && (press1 || press2 || press3 || pressQ || pressO || pressR));
  !(pressQ && (press1 || press2 || press3 || pressD || pressO || pressR));
  !(pressO && (press1 || press2 || press3 || pressD || pressQ || pressR));
  !(pressR && (press1 || press2 || press3 || pressD || pressQ || pressO));
}

always guarantee {
  // When pressD is pushed, increment the vending machine's value by 0.1
  pressD -> [total <- total + 0.10];

  // When pressQ is pushed, increment the vending machine's value by 0.25
  pressQ -> [total <- total + 0.25];

  // When pressO is pushed, increment the vending machine's value by 1
  pressO -> [total <- total + 1];

  // When press1 is pushed and the total is at least 0.75, decrement by 0.75
  press1 && total >= 0.75 -> [total <- total - 0.75];

  // When press2 is pushed and the total is at least 1, decrement by 1
  press2 && total >= 1 -> [total <- total - 1];

  // When press3 is pushed and the total is at least 1.25, decrement by 1.25
  press3 && total >= 1.25 -> [total <- total - 1.25];

  // When pressR is pushed, set the vending machine's value to zero
  pressR -> [total <- 0];
}
```

This TSL code segment defines the assumptions and guarantees based on the interface between the user and a vending machine. Mutual exclusion ensures that only one operation can happen at any given time, and the guarantees define how the machine's total value is updated based on user inputs.
