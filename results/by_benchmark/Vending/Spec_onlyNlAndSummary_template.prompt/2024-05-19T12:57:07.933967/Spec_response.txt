Here's the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure that no two machine operations can be performed at the same time
  !(pressD && (pressQ || pressO || press1 || press2 || press3 || pressR));
  !(pressQ && (pressD || pressO || press1 || press2 || press3 || pressR));
  !(pressO && (pressD || pressQ || press1 || press2 || press3 || pressR));
  !(press1 && (pressD || pressQ || pressO || press2 || press3 || pressR));
  !(press2 && (pressD || pressQ || pressO || press1 || press3 || pressR));
  !(press3 && (pressD || pressQ || pressO || press1 || press2 || pressR));
  !(pressR && (pressD || pressQ || pressO || press1 || press2 || press3));
}

always guarantee {
  // Increment total when d, q, or o is pressed
  pressD -> [total <- total + 0.1];
  pressQ -> [total <- total + 0.25];
  pressO -> [total <- total + 1];

  // Decrement total for product purchases if conditions are met
  (press1 && total >= 0.75) -> [total <- total - 0.75];
  (press2 && total >= 1) -> [total <- total - 1];
  (press3 && total >= 1.25) -> [total <- total - 1.25];

  // Reset total to 0 when r is pressed
  pressR -> [total <- 0];
}
```

This TSL specification accurately implements the operational logic described, ensuring that button presses interact with the vending machine's monetary total as specified. It also enforces mutual exclusivity between button operations to prevent simultaneous actions that could conflict or lead to erroneous states.
