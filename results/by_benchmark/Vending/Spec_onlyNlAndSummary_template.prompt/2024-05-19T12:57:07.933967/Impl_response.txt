To implement the predicates in a TSL template for a vending machine scenario using the provided signal states from the "cells" and without any specific system API functions, the predicates would look like this:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Define predicates for evaluating total
  isLessThanPoint75(total) <-> total < 0.75;
  isLessThanOne(total) <-> total < 1;
  isLessThanOnePoint25(total) <-> total < 1.25;

  // Define predicates for button presses corresponding to cell 'e'
  pressD(e) <-> e == 'd';
  pressQ(e) <-> e == 'q';
  pressO(e) <-> e == 'o';
  press1(e) <-> e == '1';
  press2(e) <-> e == '2';
  press3(e) <-> e == '3';
  pressR(e) <-> e == 'r';
}

always guarantee {
  // This section would typically contain the business logic responses to the predicates,
  // but since no functions are to be implemented, this section is empty.
}
```

Explanation:
- `always assume` block: This block defines the conditions under which the system operates. We make assumptions about the state of `total` and `e` using predicates. Predicates are defined using a logical equivalence (`<->`) to indicate their truthiness based on the state of the relevant cell.
- `always guarantee` block: This block would typically detail how the system should respond when certain conditions (defined in the `assume` block) are met. In this scenario, since no functions are implemented, the block remains empty and serves as a placeholder for potential future logic.

This TSL template assumes that the value comparisons (like `< 0.75`) and character comparisons (`== 'd'`) are valid operations within TSL's environment for handling cell data. This will need to be adjusted if the TSL environment or its integration has specific requirements or different syntax for these comparisons.
