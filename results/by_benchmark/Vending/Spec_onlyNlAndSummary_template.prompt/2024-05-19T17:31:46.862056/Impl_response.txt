To create the Temporal Stream Logic (TSL) templates based on the predicates and cells described in the prompt, you first need to understand the predicates' behavior in the context of a vending machine. The predicates involve checking certain conditions about `total` and detecting key presses from `e`.

Let's construct the TSL templates for the assumptions and guarantees provided by these predicates.

### TSL Template

```TSL
always assume {
    // Assumptions about the environment's input - here, mainly how the input signals behave
    (isLessThanPoint75(total) <-> (total < 0.75)) ;
    (isLessThanOne(total) <-> (total < 1)) ;
    (isLessThanOnePoint25(total) <-> (total < 1.25)) ;
    (pressD(e) <-> (e == 'D')) ;
    (pressQ(e) <-> (e == 'Q')) ;
    (pressO(e) <-> (e == 'O')) ;
    (press1(e) <-> (e == '1')) ;
    (press2(e) <-> (e == '2')) ;
    (press3(e) <-> (e == '3')) ;
    (pressR(e) <-> (e == 'R')) ;
}

always guarantee {
    // Guarantees about how the system should behave in response to the input
    // These would typically involve using the predicates to conditionally control system outputs
    // For example, outputs could be state changes, messages, or other actions
    // This section needs specific requirements to fill, which would be based on system design specifications
    // Example:
    pressD(e) -> [command <- dispenseDrink()] W pressR(e);
    pressQ(e) -> [command <- increaseTotalBy(0.25)] W pressR(e);
    pressO(e) -> [command <- openMachine()] W pressR(e);
    press1(e) -> [command <- selectProduct1()] W pressR(e);
    press2(e) -> [command <- selectProduct2()] W pressR(e);
    press3(e) -> [command <- selectProduct3()] W pressR(e);
    (isLessThanPoint75(total) && pressR(e)) -> [command <- insufficientFunds()] ;
    (!isLessThanPoint75(total) && pressR(e)) -> [command <- sufficientFundsForBasicItems()] ;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **always assume**: This section defines the logical behavior of the input predicates. It correlates the actual conditions with the predicates' names using equivalence (`<->`). This ensures that the predicates accurately represent the system state as described.

2. **always guarantee**: This section specifies actions or commands the system should execute based on the predicates. The actual commands like `dispenseDrink()` or `increaseTotalBy(0.25)` are pseudocode and depend on the actual API methods available in the vending machine system. The use of the weak until (`W`) operator suggests that the system maintains a certain state until a resetting event (like pressing 'R') occurs. 

This template sets a framework for integrating the predicates with the system's behavior and requires fleshing out with actual system-specific commands and further state management logic depending on the complete functionality of the vending machine.
