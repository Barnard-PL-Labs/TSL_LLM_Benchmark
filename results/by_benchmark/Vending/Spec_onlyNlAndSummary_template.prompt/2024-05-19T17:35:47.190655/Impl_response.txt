To implement the predicates described for the system, you would write JavaScript functions that check the conditions based on given inputs. Since the description suggests these are predicates related to a vending machine system, and assuming the system's API directly provides the values for `total` and key press states in `e`, the functions would look as follows:

```javascript
// Predicate to check if the total is less than 0.75
function isLessThanPoint75(total) {
    return total < 0.75;
}

// Predicate to check if the total is less than 1
function isLessThanOne(total) {
    return total < 1;
}

// Predicate to check if the total is less than 1.25
function isLessThanOnePoint25(total) {
    return total < 1.25;
}

// Predicate to check if the 'd' key was pressed
function pressD(e) {
    return e.key === 'd';
}

// Predicate to check if the 'q' key was pressed
function pressQ(e) {
    return e.key === 'q';
}

// Predicate to check if the 'o' key was pressed
function pressO(e) {
    return e.key === 'o';
}

// Predicate to check if the '1' key was pressed
function press1(e) {
    return e.key === '1';
}

// Predicate to check if the '2' key was pressed
function press2(e) {
    return e.key === '2';
}

// Predicate to check if the '3' key was pressed
function press3(e) {
    return e.key === '3';
}

// Predicate to check if the 'r' key was pressed
function pressR(e) {
    return e.key === 'r';
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Total Comparisons (`isLessThanPoint75`, `isLessThanOne`, `isLessThanOnePoint25`)**: Each of these functions takes the `total` value as an input and returns true if the `total` is less than the specified amount. This allows the system to make decisions based on the total amount available or entered.

2. **Key Press Functions (`pressD`, `pressQ`, `pressO`, `press1`, `press2`, `press3`, `pressR`)**: These functions take an event object `e` which includes details about key presses. Each function checks if the specific key was pressed by comparing `e.key` to the desired character. This can be used to handle user inputs in the vending machine system for performing specific tasks like selecting items or operations.

By defining these functions, the vending machine system can easily evaluate conditions necessary for its operations, such as determining the total amount inserted or responding to user key presses.
