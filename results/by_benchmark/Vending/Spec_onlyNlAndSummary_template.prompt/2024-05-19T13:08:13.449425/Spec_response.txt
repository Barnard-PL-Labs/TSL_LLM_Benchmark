Here is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Mutual exclusion for all button presses
  !(pressD(e) && pressQ(e));
  !(pressD(e) && pressO(e));
  !(pressD(e) && press1(e));
  !(pressD(e) && press2(e));
  !(pressD(e) && press3(e));
  !(pressD(e) && pressR(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && pressO(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && press1(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && press2(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && press3(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && pressR(e));
  !(pressO(e) && press1(e));
  !(pressO(e) && press2(e));
  !(pressO(e) && press3(e));
  !(pressO(e) && pressR(e));
  !(press1(e) && press2(e));
  !(press1(e) && press3(e));
  !(press1(e) && pressR(e));
  !(press2(e) && press3(e));
  !(press2(e) && pressR(e));
  !(press3(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Increment total by 0.1 when D is pressed
  pressD(e) -> [total <- total + 0.1];

  // Increment total by 0.25 when Q is pressed
  pressQ(e) -> [total <- total + 0.25];

  // Increment total by 1 when O is pressed
  pressO(e) -> [total <- total + 1];

  // Decrement total by 0.75 when 1 is pressed and total >= 0.75
  (press1(e) && total >= 0.75) -> [total <- total - 0.75];

  // Ensure total is unchanged when press1 is attempted with insufficient funds
  (press1(e) && total < 0.75) -> [total <- total];

  // Decrement total by 1 when 2 is pressed and total >= 1
  (press2(e) && total >= 1) -> [total <- total - 1];

  // Ensure total is unchanged when press2 is attempted with insufficient funds
  (press2(e) && total < 1) -> [total <- total];

  // Decrement total by 1.25 when 3 is pressed and total >= 1.25
  (press3(e) && total >= 1.25) -> [total <- total - 1.25];

  // Ensure total is unchanged when press3 is attempted with insufficient funds
  (press3(e) && total < 1.25) -> [total <- total];

  // Reset total to 0 when R is pressed
  pressR(e) -> [total <- 0];
}
```

This TSL specification handles the mutual exclusivity of button presses in a vending machine setup, ensuring that only one button can be pressed at any given time. It also correctly adjusts the machine's total value depending on the button pressed and the current amount in the machine, adhering to the conditions specified for each button.
