Based on the given description, the predicates can be defined in Temporal Stream Logic (TSL) using the provided predicates and cells. Here is how to set up the `always assume` and `always guarantee` blocks to define them:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Conditions based on the value of 'total'
  isLessThanPoint75(total) <-> (total < 0.75);
  isLessThanOne(total) <-> (total < 1);
  isLessThanOnePoint25(total) <-> (total < 1.25);

  // Conditions based on the value of 'e'
  pressD(e) <-> (e == 'd');
  pressQ(e) <-> (e == 'q');
  pressO(e) <-> (e == 'o');
  press1(e) <-> (e == '1');
  press2(e) <-> (e == '2');
  press3(e) <-> (e == '3');
  pressR(e) <-> (e == 'r');
}

always guarantee {
  // Define your system's reactions or guarantees here
  // Example:
  // pressD(e) -> [vendingMachine.signal <- activateD()];
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Assumptions (`always assume`):** This section is used to define the relationship between the input or state of the system and certain predicates. We use logical equivalence (`<->`) to directly map the predicates to the conditions expressed in natural language.
  
- **Guarantees (`always guarantee`):** This section specifies the system's behavior based on the predicates defined in the assumptions. For instance, if a certain key press is detected, then some corresponding action is taken, like activating a signal in the vending machine.

### Note:
- The actual TSL syntax may vary depending on the specific implementation and tools used for TSL processing.
- As per your request, no JavaScript functions are implemented, and the system behavior is entirely defined within the TSL framework.
- This setup assumes that the vending machine's control logic or other system behaviors will react to these predicates, which should be specified in the `always guarantee` section depending on the system requirements.
