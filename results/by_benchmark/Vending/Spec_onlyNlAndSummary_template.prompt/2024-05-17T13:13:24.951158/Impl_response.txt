Since there are no JavaScript functions to implement according to the task description, we will directly create the Temporal Stream Logic (TSL) template for the vending machine using the specified predicates. TSL is useful in defining the reactive behavior of systems over time based on environmental interactions.

```tsl
always assume {
    // Define the behavior of predicates based on the values of 'total' and 'e'
    isLessThanPoint75(total) <-> (total < 0.75);
    isLessThanOne(total) <-> (total < 1);
    isLessThanOnePoint25(total) <-> (total < 1.25);
    pressD(e) <-> (e == 'd');
    pressQ(e) <-> (e == 'q');
    pressO(e) <-> (e == 'o');
    press1(e) <-> (e == '1');
    press2(e) <-> (e == '2');
    press3(e) <-> (e == '3');
    pressR(e) <-> (e == 'r');
}

always guarantee {
    // Here, we would normally describe guarantees based on the predicates from assumptions.
    // However, without knowing the specifics of the actions that should be taken,
    // this part is left generic.

    // Example of possible guarantee (not real, as no actions are defined):
    // If 'total' is less than 0.75, and the user presses 'd', then trigger some action
    // (pressD(e) && isLessThanPoint75(total)) -> [action <- someResponse()];
}
```

In this TSL description:
- The **always assume** block contains statements that establish the relationship between the system's sensory inputs (like `total` and `e`) and the predicates defined.
- The **always guarantee** block would normally contain the logic of how the system should react based on these assumptions. Since the desired responses or actions are not defined in the problem statement, this part is illustrative and requires further definition based on specific system behavior requirements.

Please note that in a real implementation, you would replace dummy actions and responses with actual system API calls or responses as defined by the vending machine's requirements.
