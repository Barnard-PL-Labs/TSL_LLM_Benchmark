Since the request is to not implement any functions but to express the requirements as a Temporal Stream Logic (TSL) template using predicates and system interactions, hereâ€™s how you can structure the TSL template based on the predicates provided:

```tsl
always assume {
    // Define the total cell and the input event cell 'e'
    (total) ;
    (e) ;
  
    // Define the predicates based on the conditions given
    (isLessThanPoint75(total) == (total < 0.75)) ;
    (isLessThanOne(total) == (total < 1)) ;
    (isLessThanOnePoint25(total) == (total < 1.25)) ;
    (pressD(e) == (e.key == 'd')) ;
    (pressQ(e) == (e.key == 'q')) ;
    (pressO(e) == (e.key == 'o')) ;
    (press1(e) == (e.key == '1')) ;
    (press2(e) == (e.key == '2')) ;
    (press3(e) == (e.key == '3')) ;
    (pressR(e) == (e.key == 'r')) ;
}

always guarantee {
    // Example guarantees based on the predicates defined above:
    // If the user presses 'd', then the total should be less than 0.75 until a different key is pressed
    pressD(e) -> (isLessThanPoint75(total) W !(pressQ(e) || pressO(e) || press1(e) || press2(e) || press3(e) || pressR(e)));

    // If the user presses 'q', then the total should be less than 1 until a different key is pressed
    pressQ(e) -> (isLessThanOne(total) W !(pressD(e) || pressO(e) || press1(e) || press2(e) || press3(e) || pressR(e)));

    // If the user presses 'o', then the total should be less than 1.25 until a different key is pressed
    pressO(e) -> (isLessThanOnePoint25(total) W !(pressD(e) || pressQ(e) || press1(e) || press2(e) || press3(e) || pressR(e)));

    // Ensuring mutual exclusions between key presses
    !(pressD(e) && pressQ(e)) ;
    !(pressD(e) && pressO(e)) ;
    !(pressD(e) && press1(e)) ;
    !(pressD(e) && press2(e)) ;
    !(pressD(e) && press3(e)) ;
    !(pressD(e) && pressR(e)) ;

    // Similarly define for other keys...
}
```

This TSL configuration first defines the expected assumptions about the state of the system and the predicates for user actions. It then sets up guarantee rules that respond to these actions by checking certain conditions. The `W` (weak until) operator is used to maintain these conditions until other conditions are met (e.g., another key press), ensuring that the vending machine acts correctly according to the total amount of money and the user inputs provided.
