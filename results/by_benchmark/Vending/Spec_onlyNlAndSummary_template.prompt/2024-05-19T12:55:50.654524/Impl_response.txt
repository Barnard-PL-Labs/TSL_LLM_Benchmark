Given the requirements and the API limitations stated, here's how you can set up the predicates in TSL (Temporal Stream Logic) for the vending machine:

```tsl
always assume {
    // Total amount predicates
    isLessThanPoint75(total) -> (total < 0.75);
    isLessThanOne(total) -> (total < 1.0);
    isLessThanOnePoint25(total) -> (total < 1.25);

    // Key press predicates
    pressD(e) -> (e.key == 'd');
    pressQ(e) -> (e.key == 'q');
    pressO(e) -> (e.key == 'o');
    press1(e) -> (e.key == '1');
    press2(e) -> (e.key == '2');
    press3(e) -> (e.key == '3');
    pressR(e) -> (e.key == 'r');
}
always guarantee {
    // Describe how the system reacts to these inputs
    // This part would be specific to the vending machine logic, for example:
    pressQ(e) -> [displayMessage <- "Quit Requested"];
    pressD(e) -> [displayMessage <- "Drink Dispensed"] W pressR(e);
    isLessThanPoint75(total) -> [displayMessage <- "Insufficient Funds"] W (total >= 0.75);
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Predicates Definition**:
   - `isLessThanPoint75(total)`, `isLessThanOne(total)`, and `isLessThanOnePoint25(total)` are implemented based on the 'total' input, which is a numerical value representing the amount of money inserted into the vending machine.
   - The key press predicates like `pressD(e)`, `pressQ(e)`, and others are implemented based on the 'e' input, which is an event object that contains information about the key pressed (`e.key`).

2. **Always Assume Block**:
   - This block contains the definitions of predicates based on the inputs. These are assumptions about how the input can be interpreted (e.g., when a certain key is pressed or when the total amount meets specific conditions).

3. **Always Guarantee Block**:
   - This block would typically contain the system's responses or guarantees based on the assumed conditions. For instance, if the 'Q' key is pressed, the machine might display a message that a quit request has been made.
   - The `W` (weak until) operator is used here to demonstrate an ongoing condition until another condition is met, such as displaying a message about insufficient funds until enough money is inserted.

This TSL template defines the environment's assumptions and the system's guarantees, which can be used to model the behavior of the vending machine based on inputs from the environment.
