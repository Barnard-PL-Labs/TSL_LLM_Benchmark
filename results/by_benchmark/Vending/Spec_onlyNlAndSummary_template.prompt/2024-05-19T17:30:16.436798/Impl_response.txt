To implement the predicates specified in your requirements, we'll define them within the context of a TSL template. Given that these predicates are meant to determine specific conditions, we will outline them under the `always assume` section of the TSL template, which encapsulates the conditions or the state of the environment that the system should always assume to be true at any given time. This setup will not include the actions (since no functions are to be implemented), focusing solely on defining the predicates.

Here is how you could set up the TSL template with the predicates defined using the natural language descriptions provided:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Predicate that checks if 'total' is less than 0.75
  isLessThanPoint75(total) <- (total < 0.75);
  
  // Predicate that checks if 'total' is less than 1
  isLessThanOne(total) <- (total < 1);
  
  // Predicate that checks if 'total' is less than 1.25
  isLessThanOnePoint25(total) <- (total < 1.25);
  
  // Predicate to check if the 'd' key is pressed
  pressD(e) <- (e.key == 'd');
  
  // Predicate to check if the 'q' key is pressed
  pressQ(e) <- (e.key == 'q');
  
  // Predicate to check if the 'o' key is pressed
  pressO(e) <- (e.key == 'o');
  
  // Predicate to check if the '1' key is pressed
  press1(e) <- (e.key == '1');
  
  // Predicate to check if the '2' key is pressed
  press2(e) <- (e.key == '2');
  
  // Predicate to check if the '3' key is pressed
  press3(e) <- (e.key == '3');
  
  // Predicate to check if the 'r' key is pressed
  pressR(e) <- (e.key == 'r');
}
```

In this setup:
- Each predicate is defined using an arrow `<-` which indicates the assignment of a boolean expression to the predicate. 
- The expressions on the right-hand side of the `<-` are typical boolean conditions that evaluate based on the state of the `total` cell or the properties of the event `e`.
- These predicates will be used within the TSL system to handle logic based on the state of inputs and user interactions as outlined.

This TSL structure assumes that the system continuously evaluates these predicates based on the changing values of `total` and the event `e`, which encapsulate user inputs or other system-related triggers.
