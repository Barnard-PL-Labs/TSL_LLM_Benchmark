Here is a TSL template using the provided predicates, without implementing any functions. This template assumes reactive behaviors based on the cell states and key presses within a system, such as a vending machine, designed to handle monetary inputs and selection commands.

```tsl
always assume {
    // Define the behavior of the total cell and e cell based on signals
    (total >= 0.0); // Total should be non-negative
    // Define exclusive key presses using the e cell
    !(pressD(e) && pressQ(e));
    !(pressD(e) && pressO(e));
    !(pressD(e) && press1(e));
    !(pressD(e) && press2(e));
    !(pressD(e) && press3(e));
    !(pressD(e) && pressR(e));
    !(pressQ(e) && pressO(e));
    !(pressQ(e) && press1(e));
    !(pressQ(e) && press2(e));
    !(pressQ(e) && press3(e));
    !(pressQ(e) && pressR(e));
    !(pressO(e) && press1(e));
    !(pressO(e) && press2(e));
    !(pressO(e) && press3(e));
    !(pressO(e) && pressR(e));
    !(press1(e) && press2(e));
    !(press1(e) && press3(e));
    !(press1(e) && pressR(e));
    !(press2(e) && press3(e));
    !(press2(e) && pressR(e));
    !(press3(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
    // Define actions based on the total value and key presses
    isLessThanPoint75(total) -> (pressD(e) W isLessThanOne(total));
    isLessThanOne(total) -> (pressQ(e) W isLessThanOnePoint25(total));
    isLessThanOnePoint25(total) -> (pressO(e));

    // Handling vending machine selection based on key presses
    press1(e) -> [selectProduct1()]; // Action function not implemented here
    press2(e) -> [selectProduct2()];
    press3(e) -> [selectProduct3()];

    // If the `r` key is pressed, reset the machine
    pressR(e) -> [resetMachine()];
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Assumptions**:
   - Ensures that the `total` value is non-negative.
   - Exclusive key presses are defined to avoid simultaneous keypress handling, which is unrealistic for a physical interface like a vending machine.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - Each of the predicates based on the `total` value determines whether certain key presses are valid until another stage is reached (using the **Weak Until** operator `W`). For example, if the total is less than $0.75, pressing the 'D' key is handled until the total is less than $1.
   - Product selection keys (`1`, `2`, `3`) are linked to non-implemented function calls that would handle the respective product selections.
   - The `r` key press triggers a system reset, also linked to a non-implemented function.

This template sets up a simple basis for handling a vending machine's operation in terms of key presses and monetary input, reacting to changes in state and user inputs while ensuring mutual exclusivity in its operations.
