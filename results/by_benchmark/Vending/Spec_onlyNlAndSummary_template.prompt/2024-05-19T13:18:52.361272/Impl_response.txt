Based on the description provided, here's how you can implement the predicates using TSL (Temporal Stream Logic) in a way that specifies the behaviors of a vending machine system. This setup will use the predicates to guide the system's behavior based on the signals received from the cell values `total` and `e`.

## TSL Template for Vending Machine Behavior

```plaintext
always assume {
  // No specific assumptions are provided for this vending machine.
}

always guarantee {
  // Check if the total is less than various amounts and respond accordingly.
  isLessThanPoint75(total) -> [action <- display("Not enough credit for any item")];
  isLessThanOne(total) -> [action <- display("Add more for item A")];
  isLessThanOnePoint25(total) -> [action <- display("Add more for item B or C")];

  // User input handling: what happens when specific keys are pressed
  pressD(e) -> [action <- dispense("Drink")];
  pressQ(e) -> [action <- dispense("Snack")];
  pressO(e) -> [action <- option("Other items")];
  press1(e) -> [action <- select("Item 1")];
  press2(e) -> [action <- select("Item 2")];
  press3(e) -> [action <- select("Item 3")];
  pressR(e) -> [action <- refund()];
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Assumptions**: Defined as a section where you can specify the environment inputs or constraints. For this task, as no particular assumptions are about the environment are stated, we leave this section basic or empty.

2. **Guarantees**: This section describes the system's reactions to various states or inputs:
   - If the total amount entered is less than 0.75, a message is displayed indicating not enough credit.
   - If the total is less than 1, a prompt is provided to add more money for a specific item.
   - Checks for other price thresholds follow the same pattern.
   - The `pressX(e)` predicates determine actions based on key presses, such as dispensing items or selecting options.

### Note:

This setup assumes that the vending machine software translates these TSL rules into real actions, like updating a display or triggering dispensers. The predicates like `isLessThanPoint75(total)` or `pressD(e)` need to be implemented within the system to evaluate the conditions accurately based on the system's real-time data.
