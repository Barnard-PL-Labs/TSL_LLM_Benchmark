Based on the requirements and predicates that need to be implemented, here is the TSL (Temporal Stream-based Specification Language) template that represents this system's behavior, assuming inputs from cells "total" and "e" and including predicates for monetary value checks and key presses. Note that actual functions for these predicates are hypothetically provided by the system API, and the TSL template does not include JavaScript implementations but rather specifies the temporal behavior using the predicates.

```tsl
always assume {
    // The values from 'total' and 'e' are sourced from the environment possibly through some sensors or user input
}

always guarantee {
    // Predicates to assume certain values are less than specific amounts
    isLessThanPoint75(total); // true if total is less than 0.75
    isLessThanOne(total);     // true if total is less than 1
    isLessThanOnePoint25(total); // true if total is less than 1.25

    // Predicates to check if specific keys are pressed
    pressD(e);  // true if key 'd' is pressed
    pressQ(e);  // true if key 'q' is pressed
    pressO(e);  // true if key 'o' is pressed
    press1(e);  // true if key '1' is pressed
    press2(e);  // true if key '2' is pressed
    press3(e);  // true if key '3' is pressed
    pressR(e);  // true if key 'r' is pressed
}

// This template can be expanded based on specific requirements or behaviors expected from the system,
// such as actions to take when certain keys are pressed or when the total goes beyond certain thresholds.
```

### Explanation:
- **always assume**: This block is where you specify assumptions about inputs or the environment. For this scenario, it's assumed that the necessary values and actions (like key presses) are being correctly reported to the system.
  
- **always guarantee**: This block specifies the expected behaviors or checks the system must ensure based on the inputs. Here, the predicates are listed to evaluate specific conditions like amounts being less than given values or certain keys being pressed.

This TSL template framework sets up the structure for defining temporal behaviors and constraints based on the system environment's input. The actual implementation in JavaScript or another system would require access to the API that provides these predicates or a way to simulate them.
