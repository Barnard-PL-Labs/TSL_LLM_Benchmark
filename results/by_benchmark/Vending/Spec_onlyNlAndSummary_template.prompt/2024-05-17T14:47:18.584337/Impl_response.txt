To implement the predicates you've outlined using TSL (Temporal Stream Logic), we'll need to define both input assumptions and system guarantees. In this case, the predicates are primarily conditions that will affect the system's reactions, so they will be incorporated into the assumptions part of the TSL template. Since you've specified not to implement any functions and to only create the predicates, the focus will be on the logical expressions.

Here's how you might write these predicates in a TSL template, assuming that each predicate represents an environmental input condition:

```tsl
always assume {
    // Predicates about the value of 'total'
    isLessThanPoint75(total): (total < 0.75);
    isLessThanOne(total): (total < 1);
    isLessThanOnePoint25(total): (total < 1.25);

    // Predicates about the key press events in 'e'
    pressD(e): (e == 'd');
    pressQ(e): (e == 'q');
    pressO(e): (e == 'o');
    press1(e): (e == '1');
    press2(e): (e == '2');
    press3(e): (e == '3');
    pressR(e): (e == 'r');
}

always guarantee {
    // The reaction of the system based on the predicates isn't specified
    // Placeholder for system guarantees
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Predicates related to 'total'**:
   - `isLessThanPoint75(total)`, `isLessThanOne(total)`, and `isLessThanOnePoint25(total)` are predicates checking if the value of `total` is less than 0.75, 1, and 1.25 respectively. These conditions are set up in the `always assume` block since they define the conditions under which the system operates.

2. **Key Press Predicates**:
   - `pressD(e)`, `pressQ(e)`, `pressO(e)`, `press1(e)`, `press2(e)`, `press3(e)`, and `pressR(e)` check for specific keypress events. These are modeled by comparing the input variable `e` to specific characters representing keys.

This template forms the basis of a TSL environment where the behavior of a vending machine (or similar system) can be dictated by these predicates. The actual system guarantees (how the system should respond to these inputs) would need more information about desired behaviors and outcomes. This setup ensures that any TSL-based synthesis tool or runtime using this specification knows precisely under which conditions to evaluate system responses.
