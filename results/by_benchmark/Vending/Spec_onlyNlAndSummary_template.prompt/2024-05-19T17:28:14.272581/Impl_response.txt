To implement the predicates without defining additional functions in JavaScript, you can write the predicates directly as expressions in a TSL template. Here's how you can structure the TSL template for the predicates describing the conditions:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Define the predicates based on the cell values and events 'total' and 'e'
}

always guarantee {
  // Here you would define the behavior of the system based on the predicates
  (total < 0.75) -> isLessThanPoint75(total);
  (total < 1.00) -> isLessThanOne(total);
  (total < 1.25) -> isLessThanOnePoint25(total);

  (e == 'd') -> pressD(e);
  (e == 'q') -> pressQ(e);
  (e == 'o') -> pressO(e);
  (e == '1') -> press1(e);
  (e == '2') -> press2(e);
  (e == '3') -> press3(e);
  (e == 'r') -> pressR(e);
}
```

### Explanation:
- The `always assume` block is typically where you describe the expected inputs or conditions coming from the environment. Since this is a simulation or a behavior description scenario, it's left blank or can include assumed behaviors or values.
  
- The `always guarantee` block specifies how the system should respond to these inputs. It maps the raw input values to the predicates by using TSL conditions:
  - `(total < X)` checks if the `total` cell is less than a specific value.
  - `(e == 'X')` checks if event `e` matches a certain key press, simulating a button press on a vending machine.

Each predicate effectively becomes a condition check against the system's state, represented by `total` and `e`. The mappings in the `always guarantee` block are where you would encode the specific logic that responds to these predicates being true.

This approach leverages TSL's capabilities to specify the conditions in a way that is clear, ensuring the system's behavior aligns with the predicate's intention without implementing any JavaScript functions directly. This aligns with the requirement not to use additional functions but to rely on TSL templates to simulate the logic.
