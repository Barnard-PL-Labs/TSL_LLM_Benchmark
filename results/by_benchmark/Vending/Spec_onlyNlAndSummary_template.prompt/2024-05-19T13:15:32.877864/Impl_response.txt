To implement the predicates as described for a vending machine using the TSL template, we will encapsulate the logic for checking various conditions related to the total amount and key presses. Here is the TSL format for these predicates, assuming that there is a proper environment setup to evaluate these predicates.

```tsl
always assume {
  // Predicate definitions assuming 'total' and 'e' are available in the environment
  isLessThanPoint75(total) = (total < 0.75);
  isLessThanOne(total) = (total < 1);
  isLessThanOnePoint25(total) = (total < 1.25);
  pressD(e) = (e == 'd');
  pressQ(e) = (e == 'q');
  pressO(e) = (e == 'o');
  press1(e) = (e == '1');
  press2(e) = (e == '2');
  press3(e) = (e == '3');
  pressR(e) = (e == 'r');
}

always guarantee {
  // Here you can place the guarantees based on the predicates, for instance:
  // if total is less than $1, a certain product cannot be dispensed
  isLessThanOne(total) -> [productDispense <- false];
  
  // if 'd' key is pressed, perform an action, for example, increment the total by 0.25
  pressD(e) -> [total <- total + 0.25];

  // Further actions can be defined based on key presses and total amount
}
```

This TSL template assumes there are mechanisms (`total` and `e` variables) continuously updated by the environment that represents the vending machine's state. The `always assume` block defines how the predicates are evaluated based on these variables. The `always guarantee` section can use these predicates to define how the system should behave when certain conditions are met, like disabling the dispensing of a product or updating the total amount when a key is pressed.
