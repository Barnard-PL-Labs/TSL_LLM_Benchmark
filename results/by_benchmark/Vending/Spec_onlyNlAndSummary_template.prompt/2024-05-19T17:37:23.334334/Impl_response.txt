To create predicates in the TSL format from the described API and requirements, we need to establish conditions that reflect the logic of each predicate, such as whether specific keys are pressed or certain monetary thresholds are not exceeded. Here's a TSL template incorporating the predicates you've outlined:

```tsl
always assume {
    // Define the monetary thresholds for the vending machine
    (total < 0.75) ;
    (total < 1) ;
    (total < 1.25) ;

    // Define the key presses and their exclusive nature
    (pressD(e) || pressQ(e) || pressO(e) || press1(e) || press2(e) || press3(e) || pressR(e)) ;
    !(pressD(e) && pressQ(e)) ;
    !(pressD(e) && pressO(e)) ;
    !(pressD(e) && press1(e)) ;
    !(pressD(e) && press2(e)) ;
    !(pressD(e) && press3(e)) ;
    !(pressD(e) && pressR(e)) ;
    !(pressQ(e) && pressO(e)) ;
    !(pressQ(e) && press1(e)) ;
    !(pressQ(e) && press2(e)) ;
    !(pressQ(e) && press3(e)) ;
    !(pressQ(e) && pressR(e)) ;
    !(pressO(e) && press1(e)) ;
    !(pressO(e) && press2(e)) ;
    !(pressO(e) && press3(e)) ;
    !(pressO(e) && pressR(e)) ;
    !(press1(e) && press2(e)) ;
    !(press1(e) && press3(e)) ;
    !(press1(e) && pressR(e)) ;
    !(press2(e) && press3(e)) ;
    !(press2(e) && pressR(e)) ;
    !(press3(e) && pressR(e)) ;
}

always guarantee {
  // Implement the press checks directly in predicates
  total < 0.75 -> [ isLessThanPoint75 <- true ];
  total >= 0.75 -> [ isLessThanPoint75 <- false ];

  total < 1 -> [ isLessThanOne <- true ];
  total >= 1 -> [ isLessThanOne <- false ];

  total < 1.25 -> [ isLessThanOnePoint25 <- true ];
  total >= 1.25 -> [ isLessThanOnePoint25 <- false ];

  pressD(e) -> [ pressD <- true ];
  !pressD(e) -> [ pressD <- false ];

  pressQ(e) -> [ pressQ <- true ];
  !pressQ(e) -> [ pressQ <- false ];

  pressO(e) -> [ pressO <- true ];
  !pressO(e) -> [ pressO <- false ];

  press1(e) -> [ press1 <- true ];
  !press1(e) -> [ press1 <- false ];

  press2(e) -> [ press2 <- true ];
  !press2(e) -> [ press2 <- false ];

  press3(e) -> [ press3 <- true ];
  !press3(e) -> [ press3 <- false ];

  pressR(e) -> [ pressR <- true ];
  !pressR(e) -> [ pressR <- false ];
}
```

This TSL template assumes mutual exclusivity among key presses, which is common in user input scenarios, and establishes conditions both for pressing and not pressing each key.

The guarantees ensure that the predicates are active based on the state of the total and the key pressed, thereby reflecting the system's behavior according to the provided API and conditions. These predicates could then be used in further logic pertaining to the operation of a vending machine or another application using the specified keys and monetary thresholds.
