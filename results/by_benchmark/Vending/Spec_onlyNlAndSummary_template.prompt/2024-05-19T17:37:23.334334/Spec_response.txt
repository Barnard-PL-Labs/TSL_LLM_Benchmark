Here is the TSL (Temporal Stream Logic) specification based on the described natural language requirements for the vending machine:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure mutual exclusion between button presses
  !(press1 && (press2 || press3 || pressD || pressQ || pressO || pressR));
  !(press2 && (press1 || press3 || pressD || pressQ || pressO || pressR));
  !(press3 && (press1 || press2 || pressD || pressQ || pressO || pressR));
  !(pressD && (press1 || press2 || press3 || pressQ || pressO || pressR));
  !(pressQ && (press1 || press2 || press3 || pressD || pressO || pressR));
  !(pressO && (press1 || press2 || press3 || pressD || pressQ || pressR));
  !(pressR && (press1 || press2 || press3 || pressD || pressQ || pressO));
}

always guarantee {
  // Button presses increment or decrement the total dollar amount in the vending machine.
  pressD -> [total <- total + 0.1];
  pressQ -> [total <- total + 0.25];
  pressO -> [total <- total + 1];
  pressR -> [total <- 0];

  // Checking conditions before allowing product purchase
  (press1 && !isLessThanPoint75(total)) -> [total <- total - 0.75];
  (press2 && !isLessThanOne(total)) -> [total <- total - 1];
  (press3 && !isLessThanOnePoint25(total)) -> [total <- total - 1.25];
}
```

### Explanation of TSL Code:

1. **Assumptions**: The `always assume` block ensures that no two buttons related to machine operations can be pressed simultaneously, enforcing mutual exclusion among the button presses. This ensures no conflicting operations occur at the same time.

2. **Guarantees**: The `always guarantee` block ensures the following:
   - When buttons `pressD`, `pressQ`, `pressO`, and `pressR` are pressed, they adjust the `total` value appropriately, either incrementing it by a specified amount or resetting it to zero.
   - Product purchasing buttons (`press1`, `press2`, and `press3`) check if the current total meets the required amount before allowing the purchase, and decrement the `total` by the cost of the product if the condition is met.
  
This TSL specification adheres to the requirements and ensures the vending machine operates logically as per the given constraints.
