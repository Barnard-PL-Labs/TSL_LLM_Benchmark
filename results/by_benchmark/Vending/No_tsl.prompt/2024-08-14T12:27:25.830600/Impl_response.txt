Here's a JavaScript function implementation that matches your description and criteria using the provided predicates, cells, and operations. The function `updateState` processes user inputs to manage the state of a vending machine.

```javascript
function updateState({ currentState, e, total }) {
    let output = {};
    output.currentState = currentState; // maintain or modify currentState as needed

    // Check and handle button presses
    if (pressD(e)) {
        total += 0.10;
    } else if (pressQ(e)) {
        total += 0.25;
    } else if (pressO(e)) {
        total += 1;
    } else if (press1(e) && !isLessThanPoint75(total)) {
        total -= 0.75;
    } else if (press2(e) && !isLessThanOne(total)) {
        total -= 1;
    } else if (press3(e) && !isLessThanOnePoint25(total)) {
        total -= 1.25;
    } else if (pressR(e)) {
        total = 0;
    }

    // Set the new state of the total
    output.total = total;

    // Extend or modify output with additional state variables as necessary
    // For example, output.cellVar1 = cellVar1; (if there are other cells)

    return output;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Function Signature**: The `updateState` function takes an object containing the current state, event data `e`, and the current total as parameters.

2. **Button Presses**: The function checks which button is pressed:
   - **Inserting Coins**: If the dime (`D`), quarter (`Q`), or one-dollar (`O`) buttons are pressed, the corresponding amounts are added to the total.
   - **Purchasing Products**: If product buttons `1`, `2`, or `3` are pressed, and the balance is sufficient (as checked by the predicate functions like `isLessThanPoint75`), the corresponding product price is subtracted from the total.
   - **Refund**: If the refund button (`R`) is pressed, the total is reset to zero.
   
3. **Updating State**: The total is updated based on the operations above, and the updated state is returned.

4. **Output**: The function returns the updated `total` along with any other state changes that might be required depending on the system's requirements. This approach ensures that no two operations can override each other in a single update cycle because each operation is within mutually exclusive conditions.

This function maintains clear separation of concerns and ensures that button operations don't interfere with one another, following the given natural language description.
