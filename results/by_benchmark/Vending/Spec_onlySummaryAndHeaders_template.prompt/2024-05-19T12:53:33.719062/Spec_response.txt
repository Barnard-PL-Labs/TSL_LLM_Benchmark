To create the TSL specification for the vending machine scenario described, we need to encode assumptions about the inputs (user actions) and guarantees about the system's behavior (machine operations) in response to these inputs. Here's how this can be structured:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Mutual exclusion for all input buttons
  ! (pressD(e) && pressQ(e));
  ! (pressD(e) && pressO(e));
  ! (pressD(e) && pressR(e));
  ! (pressD(e) && press1(e));
  ! (pressD(e) && press2(e));
  ! (pressD(e) && press3(e));
  ! (pressQ(e) && pressO(e));
  ! (pressQ(e) && pressR(e));
  ! (pressQ(e) && press1(e));
  ! (pressQ(e) && press2(e));
  ! (pressQ(e) && press3(e));
  ! (pressO(e) && pressR(e));
  ! (pressO(e) && press1(e));
  ! (pressO(e) && press2(e));
  ! (pressO(e) && press3(e));
  ! (pressR(e) && press1(e));
  ! (pressR(e) && press2(e));
  ! (pressR(e) && press3(e));
  ! (press1(e) && press2(e));
  ! (press1(e) && press3(e));
  ! (press2(e) && press3(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Inserting coins
  pressD(e) -> [total <- total + 0.10]; // Dime increases total by $0.10
  pressQ(e) -> [total <- total + 0.25]; // Quarter increases total by $0.25
  pressO(e) -> [total <- total + 1.00]; // Dollar increases total by $1.00

  // Refunding money
  pressR(e) -> [total <- 0]; // Refund resets total to $0

  // Purchasing products
  (press1(e) && isLessThanPoint75(total)) -> [total <- total - 0.75]; // Purchase option 1 if total >= $0.75
  (press2(e) && isLessThanOne(total)) -> [total <- total - 1.00]; // Purchase option 2 if total >= $1
  (press3(e) && isLessThanOnePoint25(total)) -> [total <- total - 1.25]; // Purchase option 3 if total >= $1.25
}
```

This TSL specification ensures that only one action can be taken at a time by using mutual exclusion on button presses. It also guarantees the machine behaves correctly in response to each input, including updating the total amount as coins are inserted or refunded, and subtracting the correct amounts when products are purchased. The conditions for purchasing check if there is enough money before allowing a purchase to proceed.
