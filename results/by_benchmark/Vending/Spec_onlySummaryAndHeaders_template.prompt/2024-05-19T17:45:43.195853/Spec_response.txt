To translate the provided natural language description into a TSL specification, we first need to model the assumptions about the environment (inputs) and the guarantees (system reactions). The description involves managing inputs from various keys pressed and ensuring mutual exclusivity among these operations. Here's how the TSL specification might look based on the description provided:

```tsl
always assume {
    // Mutual exclusion among all button presses
    !(pressD(e) && pressQ(e));
    !(pressD(e) && pressO(e));
    !(pressD(e) && press1(e));
    !(pressD(e) && press2(e));
    !(pressD(e) && press3(e));
    !(pressD(e) && pressR(e));

    !(pressQ(e) && pressO(e));
    !(pressQ(e) && press1(e));
    !(pressQ(e) && press2(e));
    !(pressQ(e) && press3(e));
    !(pressQ(e) && pressR(e));

    !(pressO(e) && press1(e));
    !(pressO(e) && press2(e));
    !(pressO(e) && press3(e));
    !(pressO(e) && pressR(e));

    !(press1(e) && press2(e));
    !(press1(e) && press3(e));
    !(press1(e) && pressR(e));

    !(press2(e) && press3(e));
    !(press2(e) && pressR(e));

    !(press3(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
    // Handle pressing d for inserting a dime
    pressD(e) -> [total <- total + 0.10];

    // Handle pressing q for inserting a quarter
    pressQ(e) -> [total <- total + 0.25];

    // Handle pressing o for inserting a dollar
    pressO(e) -> [total <- total + 1.00];

    // Handle pressing r for refunding money
    pressR(e) -> [total <- 0];

    // Conditionally enable purchasing products based on total amount
    (!isLessThanPoint75(total) && press1(e)) -> [total <- total - 0.75];
    (!isLessThanOne(total) && press2(e)) -> [total <- total - 1.00];
    (!isLessThanOnePoint25(total) && press3(e)) -> [total <- total - 1.25];
}
```

In this specification:
- The "always assume" block declares that no two operations (represented by button presses) can happen at the same time.
- The "always guarantee" block handles the actions taken when each button is pressed. For purchasing products, it checks whether the total amount in the machine is sufficient before allowing the transaction and deducts the appropriate amount.
