For the scenario described where you need to implement predicates for a vending machine system using JavaScript, here is the appropriate code for each predicate as mentioned. Since the system API details are not provided, I'll assume basic JavaScript functions to check the conditions:

```javascript
// Predicate functions to determine the status of 'total'
function isLessThanPoint75(total) {
    return total < 0.75;
}

function isLessThanOne(total) {
    return total < 1;
}

function isLessThanOnePoint25(total) {
    return total < 1.25;
}

// Predicate functions to determine which key was pressed based on the event 'e'
function pressD(e) {
    return e.key === 'd';
}

function pressQ(e) {
    return e.key === 'q';
}

function pressO(e) {
    return e.key === 'o';
}

function press1(e) {
    return e.key === '1';
}

function press2(e) {
    return e.key === '2';
}

function press3(e) {
    return e.key === '3';
}

function pressR(e) {
    return e.key === 'r';
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Total Check Predicates**: These predicates check if the 'total' amount in the vending machine is less than specific values (0.75, 1, and 1.25). They take a number 'total' as an argument and return `true` if the condition is fulfilled, otherwise `false`.

2. **Key Press Predicates**: These predicates determine if specific keys were pressed. They check the `key` property of the event object 'e' that represents a key press event, comparing it against a specific character. Each function returns `true` if the corresponding key was pressed, otherwise `false`.

These predicates can now be used in the context of the system to perform various checks based on the state of the 'total' or user interactions through key presses.
