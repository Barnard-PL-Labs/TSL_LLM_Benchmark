It appears there might be some confusion in the task as you've mentioned using a system API to implement methods in JavaScript, but then requested not to use and implement any functions. Instead, the task seems to be more suited for creating Temporal Stream Logic (TSL) predicates for a hypothetical vending machine system based on the provided conditions. I'll proceed with generating TSL predicates, assuming these predicates are part of the system specification for a reactive system model using TSL.

Here's how you could specify these predicates in TSL:

```tsl
always assume {
    // Define predicates on the value of "total"
    isLessThanPoint75(total) <-> total < 0.75;
    isLessThanOne(total) <-> total < 1;
    isLessThanOnePoint25(total) <-> total < 1.25;

    // Define predicates for key presses based on the value of "e"
    pressD(e) <-> e == 'd';
    pressQ(e) <-> e == 'q';
    pressO(e) <-> e == 'o';
    press1(e) <-> e == '1';
    press2(e) <-> e == '2';
    press3(e) <-> e == '3';
    pressR(e) <-> e == 'r';
}

always guarantee {
    // Examples of how these predicates might be used to control the system
    // This should be defined according to the system's requirements
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Predicates on `total`:** These predicates check if the `total` is less than specific values (0.75, 1, and 1.25). These could be used in the system to decide if enough credit has been provided to purchase certain items.

2. **Key Press Predicates:** These predicates determine which key has been pressed based on the value of `e`. This is crucial for input handling in the vending machine, such as selecting items or performing other actions.

3. **System Guarantees:** In the `always guarantee` block, you would specify how the system should respond based on the predicates from the `always assume` block. This part is dependent on the specific requirements of your vending machine system and would include logic to manage state changes, dispense products, handle payments, etc.

This TSL setup helps in clearly defining how the system should react to different inputs and states, providing a robust framework for modeling and verifying the behavior of the vending machine.
