Below is the TSL specification for the vending machine system based on the provided description and functionality:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure no two machine operations occur at the same time
  !(pressD(e) && pressQ(e)) &&
  !(pressD(e) && pressO(e)) &&
  !(pressD(e) && pressR(e)) &&
  !(pressD(e) && press1(e)) &&
  !(pressD(e) && press2(e)) &&
  !(pressD(e) && press3(e)) &&
  !(pressQ(e) && pressO(e)) &&
  !(pressQ(e) && pressR(e)) &&
  !(pressQ(e) && press1(e)) &&
  !(pressQ(e) && press2(e)) &&
  !(pressQ(e) && press3(e)) &&
  !(pressO(e) && pressR(e)) &&
  !(pressO(e) && press1(e)) &&
  !(pressO(e) && press2(e)) &&
  !(pressO(e) && press3(e)) &&
  !(pressR(e) && press1(e)) &&
  !(pressR(e) && press2(e)) &&
  !(pressR(e) && press3(e)) &&
  !(press1(e) && press2(e)) &&
  !(press1(e) && press3(e)) &&
  !(press2(e) && press3(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Handling coin and dollar insertions
  pressD(e) -> [total <- total + 0.1]; // Increase total by 0.10 for dime
  pressQ(e) -> [total <- total + 0.25]; // Increase total by 0.25 for quarter
  pressO(e) -> [total <- total + 1]; // Increase total by 1 for dollar

  // Handling refunds
  pressR(e) -> [total <- 0]; // Refund the money

  // Handling product purchases
  (!isLessThanPoint75(total) && press1(e)) -> [total <- total - 0.75]; // Purchase option 1 if enough funds are available
  (!isLessThanOne(total) && press2(e)) -> [total <- total - 1]; // Purchase option 2 if enough funds are available
  (!isLessThanOnePoint25(total) && press3(e)) -> [total <- total - 1.25]; // Purchase option 3 if enough funds are available
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions**:
   - Mutual exclusion is ensured for all key presses to guarantee that no two operations (like inserting coins or selecting products) can happen simultaneously.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - Coin and dollar insertions increase the `total` by their respective amounts.
   - Pressing the refund button (R) resets the `total`.
   - Product purchase operations check if there is enough credit (using the respective predicates) before allowing a purchase and deduct the correct amount from the `total`.

This TSL specification captures all the operations of the vending machine as described, ensuring that each operation can only occur under the correct conditions and that operations do not overlap.
