To translate the given predicates into a TSL template for a vending machine system, we first define the states of the cells and then create rules within the TSL structure. Here is the TSL implementation for the vending machine based on the specified predicates:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Define cell 'total' and 'e' as inputs that the environment controls
}

always guarantee {
  // Define predicates based on the value of 'total'
  isLessThanPoint75(total) -> (total < 0.75);
  isLessThanOne(total) -> (total < 1);
  isLessThanOnePoint25(total) -> (total < 1.25);

  // Define predicates based on the value of 'e' to detect specific key presses
  pressD(e) -> (e == 'd');
  pressQ(e) -> (e == 'q');
  pressO(e) -> (e == 'o');
  press1(e) -> (e == '1');
  press2(e) -> (e == '2');
  press3(e) -> (e == '3');
  pressR(e) -> (e == 'r');
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions**: This section is left open for any conditions or constraints that are external or that the environment controls. Here, the 'total' and 'e' cells are assumed to be controlled by the environment, which means their values are given and not determined by the system.

2. **Guarantees**: This section contains the logical implementations of the predicates. Each predicate is mapped to a condition:
   - **Monetary Conditions**: `isLessThanPoint75`, `isLessThanOne`, and `isLessThanOnePoint25` check if the 'total' cell's value is less than the respective monetary limits.
   - **Key Press Conditions**: `pressD`, `pressQ`, `pressO`, `press1`, `press2`, `press3`, and `pressR` check if the 'e' cell's value matches the respective key identifier.

This TSL model ensures that the vending machine system can evaluate these conditions based on the state of inputs 'total' and 'e' to make decisions, such as enabling certain functionalities or responding to user inputs.
