Given the requirements and the context provided, here is how you could define the predicates in TSL (Temporal Stream-based Specification Language) for the vending machine system. Since the system API is described broadly without specific details, we'll make reasonable assumptions about how these predicates could be structured.

### TSL Template:
```tsl
always assume {
  (total < 0.75) -> isLessThanPoint75(total);
  (total < 1) -> isLessThanOne(total);
  (total < 1.25) -> isLessThanOnePoint25(total);
  (e == 'd') -> pressD(e);
  (e == 'q') -> pressQ(e);
  (e == 'o') -> pressO(e);
  (e == '1') -> press1(e);
  (e == '2') -> press2(e);
  (e == '3') -> press3(e);
  (e == 'r') -> pressR(e);
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Variables and Constants**:
   - `total` is assumed to be a cell representing a numeric value (money inserted, for example).
   - `e` is a cell presumably representing an event or input, such as button presses.

2. **Predicates**:
   - `isLessThanPoint75(total)`, `isLessThanOne(total)`, `isLessThanOnePoint25(total)`: These predicates check if the `total` cell's value meets certain conditions.
   - `pressD(e)`, `pressQ(e)`, `pressO(e)`, `press1(e)`, `press2(e)`, `press3(e)`, `pressR(e)`: These predicates determine if specific keys are pressed, by comparing the value of `e` to different characters. Each character represents a button on the vending machine interface.

### Assumptions:
- The cell `e` represents the last key pressed.
- The cell `total` represents the current total amount entered into the vending machine.
- The equality and relational operators (`==`, `<`) are assumed to be applicable within the predicates as per TSL's compatibility with such conditions.

This setup does not cover how these predicates might be used within actions or further conditions; it only defines the basic logical assumptions based on the inputs and states provided. The actual implementation within a TSL environment would depend on how these predicates are to be used to govern state transitions or actions within the vending machine's control system.
