Here's the TSL specification based on your description of the vending machine operation:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Assume mutual exclusion for all button presses
  !(pressD(e) && pressQ(e));
  !(pressD(e) && pressO(e));
  !(pressD(e) && pressR(e));
  !(pressD(e) && press1(e));
  !(pressD(e) && press2(e));
  !(pressD(e) && press3(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && pressO(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && pressR(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && press1(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && press2(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && press3(e));
  !(pressO(e) && pressR(e));
  !(pressO(e) && press1(e));
  !(pressO(e) && press2(e));
  !(pressO(e) && press3(e));
  !(pressR(e) && press1(e));
  !(pressR(e) && press2(e));
  !(pressR(e) && press3(e));
  !(press1(e) && press2(e));
  !(press1(e) && press3(e));
  !(press2(e) && press3(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Inserting a dime increases the total by 0.10
  pressD(e) -> [total <- total + 0.10];

  // Inserting a quarter increases the total by 0.25
  pressQ(e) -> [total <- total + 0.25];

  // Inserting a dollar increases the total by 1.00
  pressO(e) -> [total <- total + 1.00];

  // Refunding money resets the total to 0
  pressR(e) -> [total <- 0];

  // Purchasing products conditionally based on the total amount
  (press1(e) && isLessThanPoint75(total)) -> [e <- "Not enough funds for product 1"];
  (press1(e) && !isLessThanPoint75(total)) -> [total <- total - 0.75, e <- "Product 1 dispensed"];

  (press2(e) && isLessThanOne(total)) -> [e <- "Not enough funds for product 2"];
  (press2(e) && !isLessThanOne(total)) -> [total <- total - 1.00, e <- "Product 2 dispensed"];

  (press3(e) && isLessThanOnePoint25(total)) -> [e <- "Not enough funds for product 3"];
  (press3(e) && !isLessThanOnePoint25(total)) -> [total <- total - 1.25, e <- "Product 3 dispensed"];
}
```

This TSL specification ensures that button presses are mutually exclusive, and operations on the vending machine (such as inserting coins, dispensing products, or refunding money) are properly handled based on the state of the total amount in the machine.
