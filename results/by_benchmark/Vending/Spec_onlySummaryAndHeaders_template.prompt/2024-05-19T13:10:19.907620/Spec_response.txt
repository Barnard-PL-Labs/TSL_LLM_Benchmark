Here is the TSL specification based on the provided description and functions:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Mutual exclusion for all button presses
  !(pressD(e) && pressQ(e));
  !(pressD(e) && pressO(e));
  !(pressD(e) && press1(e));
  !(pressD(e) && press2(e));
  !(pressD(e) && press3(e));
  !(pressD(e) && pressR(e));

  !(pressQ(e) && pressO(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && press1(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && press2(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && press3(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && pressR(e));

  !(pressO(e) && press1(e));
  !(pressO(e) && press2(e));
  !(pressO(e) && press3(e));
  !(pressO(e) && pressR(e));

  !(press1(e) && press2(e));
  !(press1(e) && press3(e));
  !(press1(e) && pressR(e));

  !(press2(e) && press3(e));
  !(press2(e) && pressR(e));
  
  !(press3(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Insertions increasing the total
  pressD(e) -> [total <- total + 0.10];
  pressQ(e) -> [total <- total + 0.25];
  pressO(e) -> [total <- total + 1.00];

  // Product purchase conditions
  (press1(e) && isLessThanPoint75(total)) -> [total <- total - 0.75];
  (press2(e) && isLessThanOne(total)) -> [total <- total - 1.00];
  (press3(e) && isLessThanOnePoint25(total)) -> [total <- total - 1.25];

  // Refund action
  pressR(e) -> [total <- 0];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Mutual Exclusion for Button Presses:** Ensures that no two buttons that trigger machine operations can be pressed at the same time. This prevents simultaneous operations which are not allowed in the system.

2. **Guarantee for Insertions:** When 'd', 'q', or 'o' is pressed, add the respective amount to the 'total'. This simulates adding money into the vending machine.

3. **Product Purchase Conditions:** Checks if the total meets the conditions to buy a product after pressing buttons '1', '2', or '3'. If conditions are met, the respective amount is subtracted from the total, representing the purchase.

4. **Refund Action:** When 'r' is pressed, set the total amount back to 0, simulating a refund operation.

This TSL specification effectively models the operation of a vending machine with inputs from various buttons altering the state of a 'total' cell based on predefined conditions and mutual exclusivity for operations.
