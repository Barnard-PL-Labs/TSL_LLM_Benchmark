To implement the system environment with predicates using TSL, we'll follow the structure of defining assumptions and guarantees in the always assume and always guarantee clauses. Here's how you can structure your TSL based on the predicates you've been given:

```tsl
always assume {
    // For total value comparisons
    (isLessThanPoint75(total) <-> (total < 0.75));
    (isLessThanOne(total) <-> (total < 1));
    (isLessThanOnePoint25(total) <-> (total < 1.25));

    // For key presses
    (pressD(e) <-> (e == 'd'));
    (pressQ(e) <-> (e == 'q'));
    (pressO(e) <-> (e == 'o'));
    (press1(e) <-> (e == '1'));
    (press2(e) <-> (e == '2'));
    (press3(e) <-> (e == '3'));
    (pressR(e) <-> (e == 'r'));
}

always guarantee {
    // Here you would define how the system should react based on the predicates.
    // This is an example of a simple response mechanism:
    
    // If the total is less than $0.75, and key 'd' is pressed, some action can be triggered:
    (isLessThanPoint75(total) && pressD(e)) -> [action <- someAction()];

    // If key 'q' is pressed, regardless of the total, another action might be performed:
    pressQ(e) -> [anotherAction <- differentAction()];

    // Further reactions based on other key presses and conditions can be specified similarly:
    (isLessThanOne(total) && press1(e)) -> [yetAnotherAction <- yetAnotherFunction()];
    (press2(e) && !isLessThanOnePoint25(total)) -> [alternativeAction <- alternativeFunction()];
}
```

These TSL predicates and actions are conceptual and may not directly map to executable JavaScript code without a proper TSL to JavaScript interpreter or converter. However, the TSL format is useful for describing the logic in temporal and reactive systems such as the vending machine environment you've described. This setup ensures that the predicates guide the conditions under which specific actions are guaranteed to occur, maintaining the logic sequence and dependencies clear and consistent.
