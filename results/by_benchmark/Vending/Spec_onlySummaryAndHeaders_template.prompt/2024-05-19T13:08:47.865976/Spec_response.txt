Based on the provided natural language description, here is the corresponding TSL specification for the vending machine operations:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure only one operation can be performed at a time
  !(press1(e) && press2(e));
  !(press1(e) && press3(e));
  !(press1(e) && pressD(e));
  !(press1(e) && pressQ(e));
  !(press1(e) && pressO(e));
  !(press1(e) && pressR(e));
  !(press2(e) && press3(e));
  !(press2(e) && pressD(e));
  !(press2(e) && pressQ(e));
  !(press2(e) && pressO(e));
  !(press2(e) && pressR(e));
  !(press3(e) && pressD(e));
  !(press3(e) && pressQ(e));
  !(press3(e) && pressO(e));
  !(press3(e) && pressR(e));
  !(pressD(e) && pressQ(e));
  !(pressD(e) && pressO(e));
  !(pressD(e) && pressR(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && pressO(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && pressR(e));
  !(pressO(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Purchase operations based on total amount criteria
  press1(e) && isLessThanPoint75(total) -> [total <- total - 0.75];
  press2(e) && isLessThanOne(total) -> [total <- total - 1.0];
  press3(e) && isLessThanOnePoint25(total) -> [total <- total - 1.25];

  // Money insertion operations
  pressD(e) -> [total <- total + 0.10];
  pressQ(e) -> [total <- total + 0.25];
  pressO(e) -> [total <- total + 1.0];

  // Refund operation
  pressR(e) -> [total <- 0];
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Assumptions block**: This section ensures that no two machine operations can be performed simultaneously by negating the conjunction of any two possible operations.
- **Guarantees block**: 
  - It specifies the conditions under which products can be purchased, based on the total money inserted into the vending machine (`total`). Each product purchase subtracts the appropriate amount from `total`.
  - It defines the money insertion operations, where pressing specific keys increments the `total` by the respective amounts of a dime (`d`), a quarter (`q`), or a dollar (`o`).
  - The refund operation, triggered by the `r` key, resets the `total` to zero.

This specification adheres to the requirements that only one operation can be executed at a time and handles button interactions for purchasing, inserting money, and refunding.
