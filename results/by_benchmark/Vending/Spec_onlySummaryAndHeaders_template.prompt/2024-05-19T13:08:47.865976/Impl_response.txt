To implement the predicates in JavaScript as specified, without using any additional functions or wrappers, you would define each predicate directly based on the provided descriptions. Assuming `total` and `e` are accessible within the scope where these predicates are defined, here’s how you could implement these predicates:

```javascript
// Predicates for "total"
function isLessThanPoint75(total) {
    return total < 0.75;
}

function isLessThanOne(total) {
    return total < 1;
}

function isLessThanOnePoint25(total) {
    return total < 1.25;
}

// Predicates for "e" (keyboard events)
function pressD(e) {
    return e === 'd';
}

function pressQ(e) {
    return e === 'q';
}

function pressO(e) {
    return e === 'o';
}

function press1(e) {
    return e === '1';
}

function press2(e) {
    return e === '2';
}

function press3(e) {
    return e === '3';
}

function pressR(e) {
    return e === 'r';
}
```

### Usage
These predicates would be used wherever needed in your application or system to evaluate conditions based on the state of `total` or the event `e`. For instance, you might use `isLessThanPoint75(total)` to decide whether to enable a certain functionality in a vending machine if the total amount inserted is less than $0.75.

### Notes
- These functions assume that the `total` is a numerical value and that `e` is a string representing a keypress.
- Ensure that `total` and `e` are correctly updated and passed to these predicates wherever they are called in your application.
- It’s important to handle any potential errors or unexpected values gracefully, ensuring that your system maintains robustness in various scenarios.
