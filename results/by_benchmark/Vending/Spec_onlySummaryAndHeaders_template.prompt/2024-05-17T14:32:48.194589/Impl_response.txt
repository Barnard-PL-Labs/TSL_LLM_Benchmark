Based on the given description and requirement to implement predicates using a hypothetical system API, we can define the predicates in TSL (Temporal Stream Logic) within the framework of an `always assume` and `always guarantee` block. Since actual JavaScript implementation is not required, we will focus on expressing these conditions in TSL.

Here's how you might express these predicates within a TSL template in the context of a vending machine system:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Define the predicates as assumptions about the environment inputs from the vending machine's control system
  (total < 0.75) -> isLessThanPoint75(total);
  (total < 1.0) -> isLessThanOne(total);
  (total < 1.25) -> isLessThanOnePoint25(total);
  (e == 'd') -> pressD(e);
  (e == 'q') -> pressQ(e);
  (e == 'o') -> pressO(e);
  (e == '1') -> press1(e);
  (e == '2') -> press2(e);
  (e == '3') -> press3(e);
  (e == 'r') -> pressR(e);
}

always guarantee {
  // Using these predicates to define system behavior based on the cell conditions
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Predicates**:
   - Each predicate checks a condition on the cell values `total` or `e`. The checks are straightforward comparisons like `<` or equality checks `==`.
   - The conditions on the `total` cell are used to determine if the amount of money inserted into the vending machine is less than specific thresholds (`0.75`, `1.0`, `1.25`), which might correspond to the price of items or change thresholds.
   - The conditions on the `e` cell are used to check if specific keys are pressed (`d`, `q`, `o`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `r`). These could relate to user input for selecting items or other interactions with the vending machine.

2. **Structure**:
   - The `always assume` block is used to define assumptions about the inputs or environment of the system. Here, it's used to associate the environmental truths (e.g., key presses, total money entered) with the predicate functions.
   - The `always guarantee` block would typically contain the system's responses to these predicates, ensuring certain outcomes based on the input conditions. However, as per the instructions, no functions are implemented in this part for the current example.

This TSL outline provides a clear framework of how the vending machine might evaluate conditions and is prepared to extend with actions based on these predicates using the `always guarantee` block.
