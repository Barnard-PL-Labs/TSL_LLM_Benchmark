Here is the TSL specification based on the natural language description provided:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure no two machine operations can be performed at the same time.
  !(pressD(e) && pressQ(e)) && !(pressD(e) && pressO(e)) && !(pressD(e) && pressR(e)) &&
  !(pressQ(e) && pressO(e)) && !(pressQ(e) && pressR(e)) &&
  !(pressO(e) && pressR(e)) &&
  !(press1(e) && press2(e)) && !(press1(e) && press3(e)) && !(press1(e) && pressR(e)) &&
  !(press2(e) && press3(e)) && !(press2(e) && pressR(e)) &&
  !(press3(e) && pressR(e)) &&
  !(press1(e) && (pressD(e) || pressQ(e) || pressO(e))) &&
  !(press2(e) && (pressD(e) || pressQ(e) || pressO(e))) &&
  !(press3(e) && (pressD(e) || pressQ(e) || pressO(e)));
}

always guarantee {
  // Inserting different sums of money by pressing specific buttons.
  pressD(e) -> [total <- total + 0.10];
  pressQ(e) -> [total <- total + 0.25];
  pressO(e) -> [total <- total + 1.00];
  
  // Refunding the money by pressing the R key.
  pressR(e) -> [total <- 0];
  
  // Purchasing product options based on the total amount available.
  (press1(e) && isLessThanPoint75(total)) -> [total <- total - 0.75];
  (press2(e) && isLessThanOne(total)) -> [total <- total - 1.00];
  (press3(e) && isLessThanOnePoint25(total)) -> [total <- total - 1.25];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions**:
   - Mutual exclusion is ensured for all operations, meaning no two operations like button presses can happen simultaneously. This is implemented for all combinations of button presses.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - Money insertion is controlled by pressing 'd', 'q', 'o' which respectively add a dime, a quarter, and a dollar to the total.
   - Refunding resets the total to zero when 'r' is pressed.
   - Product purchasing operations check if there's enough balance before deducting the appropriate amount from the total for each product option.

This TSL specification should guide the development or simulation of a vending machine according to the criteria described in the natural language input.
