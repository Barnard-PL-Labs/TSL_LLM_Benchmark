To implement the predicates using TSL (Temporal Stream Logic), we will define conditions based on the state of certain cells (`total` and `e`). These predicates will be used to determine actions or responses of a vending machine in a system environment. Here we go:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Predicates for checking the amount in `total`
  isLessThanPoint75(total) := total < 0.75;
  isLessThanOne(total) := total < 1.0;
  isLessThanOnePoint25(total) := total < 1.25;

  // Predicates for checking key presses in `e`
  pressD(e) := e == 'd';
  pressQ(e) := e == 'q';
  pressO(e) := e == 'o';
  press1(e) := e == '1';
  press2(e) := e == '2';
  press3(e) := e == '3';
  pressR(e) := e == 'r';
}

always guarantee {
  // In the guarantee section you would define what the system should do based on the predicates
  // Example: If the 'd' key is pressed and total is less than $0.75, some action might be triggered
  pressD(e) && isLessThanPoint75(total) -> [action <- 'informUnderpaid'];
  
  // Depending on the complexity of the system, you could add more rules here reflecting the system behavior
}
```

Explanation:
- In the `always assume` section, we define the predicates based on the state of the cells, which are interpreted as conditions to evaluate.
- In the `always guarantee` section, I included an example of how these predicates might be used to control the behavior of the system (like triggering an action if a condition is met).

This structure ensures that the implementation of predicates is directly usable for controlling system behavior based on temporal logic conditions. Note that actual action bindings (`[action <- 'informUnderpaid']`) should be defined according to the actual system's capabilities and requirements.
