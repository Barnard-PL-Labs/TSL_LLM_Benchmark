In the absence of an actual JavaScript environment and with the direction to not implement any functions directly, we can instead outline what the Temporal Stream Logic (TSL) setup for such predicates would look like, based on the descriptions provided. Here, I'll create a TSL template that encapsulates the possible behaviors and predicates you've described, assuming an environment where these predicates are checked continuously or as per the system's state updates:

```tsl
always assume {
    // Assume that the total and e signals are always available
}

always guarantee {
    // Define predicates using the environment signals 'total' and 'e'
    // Check if the total is less than various thresholds
    isLessThanPoint75(total) -> (total < 0.75);
    isLessThanOne(total) -> (total < 1);
    isLessThanOnePoint25(total) -> (total < 1.25);

    // Check if certain keys are pressed based on 'e' signal
    pressD(e) -> (e == 'd');
    pressQ(e) -> (e == 'q');
    pressO(e) -> (e == 'o');
    press1(e) -> (e == '1');
    press2(e) -> (e == '2');
    press3(e) -> (e == '3');
    pressR(e) -> (e == 'r');
}
```

This TSL template assumes that:
- `total` is a valid floating-point signal available to the system that can be checked against numeric thresholds.
- `e` is a signal that represents keyboard inputs or similar event triggers where the key representation ('d', 'q', 'o', etc.) matches those expected by the predicates.

The TSL model uses these assumptions to constantly evaluate the defined predicates against the state of `total` and `e`. Each predicate utilizes a straightforward comparison, either numeric for `total` or equality for `e`. This setup ensures that the behavior of the vending machine (or any system using these predicates) can be accurately modeled and reasoned about within the temporal logic framework provided by TSL.
