Here we will translate the natural language description of the vending machine's functionality into a TSL (Temporal Stream-based Specification Language) specification. This specification will define the assumptions about the user's actions as inputs and specify the corresponding guarantees for the vending machine's behavior.

### TSL Specification for a Vending Machine

```tsl
always assume {
  // Mutual exclusion of button presses, ensuring only one button is pressed at a time.
  !(press1(e) && (press2(e) || press3(e) || pressD(e) || pressQ(e) || pressO(e) || pressR(e)));
  !(press2(e) && (press1(e) || press3(e) || pressD(e) || pressQ(e) || pressO(e) || pressR(e)));
  !(press3(e) && (press1(e) || press2(e) || pressD(e) || pressQ(e) || pressO(e) || pressR(e)));
  !(pressD(e) && (press1(e) || press2(e) || press3(e) || pressQ(e) || pressO(e) || pressR(e)));
  !(pressQ(e) && (press1(e) || press2(e) || press3(e) || pressD(e) || pressO(e) || pressR(e)));
  !(pressO(e) && (press1(e) || press2(e) || press3(e) || pressD(e) || pressQ(e) || pressR(e)));
  !(pressR(e) && (press1(e) || press2(e) || press3(e) || pressD(e) || pressQ(e) || pressO(e)));
}

always guarantee {
  // Purchase option 1 if the total amount is at least 0.75 and button 1 is pressed.
  (press1(e) && !isLessThanPoint75(total)) -> [total <- total - 0.75];

  // Purchase option 2 if the total amount is at least 1.00 and button 2 is pressed.
  (press2(e) && !isLessThanOne(total)) -> [total <- total - 1.00];

  // Purchase option 3 if the total amount is at least 1.25 and button 3 is pressed.
  (press3(e) && !isLessThanOnePoint25(total)) -> [total <- total - 1.25];

  // Insert a dime into the machine by pressing the d button.
  pressD(e) -> [total <- total + 0.10];

  // Insert a quarter into the machine by pressing the q button.
  pressQ(e) -> [total <- total + 0.25];

  // Insert a dollar into the machine by pressing the o button.
  pressO(e) -> [total <- total + 1.00];

  // Refund the total money by pressing the r button.
  pressR(e) -> [total <- 0];
}
```

This TSL specification ensures that the vending machine reacts appropriately to user input, updating the total amount stored based on button presses, and prevents multiple operations from happening simultaneously through the mutual exclusion in the assumptions. It also ensures the correct deductions or additions are made to the total based on the amount required for each product or added by each coin or bill type.
