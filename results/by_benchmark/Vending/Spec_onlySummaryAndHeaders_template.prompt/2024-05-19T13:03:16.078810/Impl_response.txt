To implement the predicates as described in the environment, here's how they can be set up in a TSL context. Since you're not using functions and this setup involves predicates, the implementation will focus on defining conditions that rely on states and inputs as specified.

Here's what the TSL template could look like:

```tsl
always assume {
    // States of the 'total' cell
    isLessThanPoint75(total) == (total < 0.75);
    isLessThanOne(total) == (total < 1);
    isLessThanOnePoint25(total) == (total < 1.25);

    // Key press states from the 'e' cell
    pressD(e) == (e == 'D' || e == 'd');
    pressQ(e) == (e == 'Q' || e == 'q');
    pressO(e) == (e == 'O' || e == 'o');
    press1(e) == (e == '1');
    press2(e) == (e == '2');
    press3(e) == (e == '3');
    pressR(e) == (e == 'R' || e == 'r');
}

always guarantee {
    // Here, the behaviors or actions based on the states can be defined.
    // For example, if a key 'D' is pressed and the total is less than 0.75:
    (pressD(e) && isLessThanPoint75(total)) -> [performSomeAction()];

    // You can define more behaviors based on the predicates.
}
```

In this setup:

- **always assume:** This section defines the conditions or predicates using the provided states and inputs. These definitions are crucial for allowing the system to "understand" the conditions based on the states of `total` or key presses from `e`.

- **always guarantee:** In this section, you can define how the system should behave based on the predicates defined. For example, actions can be triggered if certain keys are pressed and certain conditions about the `total` value are met.

This template needs to be adapted if there are specific outputs or actions that the system should execute based on these conditions. Remember, actual execution of commands like `[performSomeAction()]` would need to be defined according to the system's capabilities and the APIs provided.
