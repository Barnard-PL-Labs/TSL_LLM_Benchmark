To implement the predicates described, we need to define Boolean functions for each of the predicates related to the vending machine's operation and interactions. Since you mentioned that this should not involve implementing any functions, I will structure the predicates as expressions and conditions directly in TSL, which could be used in a TSL-based specification file for your system.

Here's how you can express these predicates within the `always assume` and `always guarantee` blocks of a TSL template, given that we're not implementing actual functions but using TSL constructs.

```tsl
always assume {
  // Here, `total` and `e` are assumed to be inputs from the environment.
  // They should be available as cells, as per your system's design.
}

always guarantee {
  // Predicates related to `total`:
  isLessThanPoint75(total) {
    (total < 0.75);
  }
  
  isLessThanOne(total) {
    (total < 1);
  }
  
  isLessThanOnePoint25(total) {
    (total < 1.25);
  }

  // Predicates related to `e` (assuming 'e' carries event information):
  pressD(e) {
    e == 'd';
  }
  
  pressQ(e) {
    e == 'q';
  }
  
  pressO(e) {
    e == 'o';
  }
  
  press1(e) {
    e == '1';
  }
  
  press2(e) {
    e == '2';
  }
  
  press3(e) {
    e == '3';
  }
  
  pressR(e) {
    e == 'r';
  }
}
```

### Explanation:

- For each predicate, I have used a comparison operator for the values related to `total`. These comparisons naturally yield Boolean results, which makes them suitable for use as predicates.

- For the key presses, it's assumed that `e` contains the identifier for the last key pressed. Each predicate checks if `e` equals a specific key identifier.

### Note:

The provided TSL snippet is an example of how you might specify conditions in a TSL environment. However, actual implementation details might vary depending on the specific TSL compiler or environment you are using, which might require adjustments to the syntax or structure. This example assumes `total` and `e` are read directly and compared or checked without additional function calls, directly in line with your specification of not implementing any additional functions.
