Based on the requirements, here is a TSL code snippet that integrates the predicates, assuming the structure of the system API and the lack of functions. This TSL template uses these predicates to define assumptions and guarantees in the system.

```tsl
always assume {
  // Predicates to signal various key presses
  !(pressD(e) && pressQ(e));
  !(pressD(e) && pressO(e));
  !(pressD(e) && press1(e));
  !(pressD(e) && press2(e));
  !(pressD(e) && press3(e));
  !(pressD(e) && pressR(e));

  !(pressQ(e) && pressO(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && press1(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && press2(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && press3(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && pressR(e));

  !(pressO(e) && press1(e));
  !(pressO(e) && press2(e));
  !(pressO(e) && press3(e));
  !(pressO(e) && pressR(e));

  !(press1(e) && press2(e));
  !(press1(e) && press3(e));
  !(press1(e) && pressR(e));

  !(press2(e) && press3(e));
  !(press2(e) && pressR(e));

  !(press3(e) && pressR(e));

  // Predicates to signal the state of total
  (total < 0.75) <-> isLessThanPoint75(total);
  (total < 1) <-> isLessThanOne(total);
  (total < 1.25) <-> isLessThanOnePoint25(total);
}

always guarantee {
  // Define system responses based on key presses and total value
  pressD(e) -> [systemActionD <- true];
  pressQ(e) -> [systemActionQ <- true];
  pressO(e) -> [systemActionO <- true];
  press1(e) -> [systemAction1 <- true];
  press2(e) -> [systemAction2 <- true];
  press3(e) -> [systemAction3 <- true];
  pressR(e) -> [systemActionR <- true];
  
  // Define system responses based on the total value conditions
  isLessThanPoint75(total) -> [enableActionPoint75 <- true];
  isLessThanOne(total) -> [enableActionOne <- true];
  isLessThanOnePoint25(total) -> [enableActionOnePoint25 <- true];
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Assumptions**: This section makes sure that no two keys are pressed simultaneously, ensuring mutual exclusion. It also binds the boolean conditions for the `total` cell to the respective predicates.

- **Guarantees**: This section responds to key presses by setting respective system action flags as `true`. Additionally, it handles actions based on the total value by enabling specific actions tied to each predicate.

This TSL template assumes the input keys are mutually exclusive, and the actions triggered by keys or `total` values are represented by setting various flags (`systemActionX` or `enableActionX`) to `true`. Adjustments may be needed based on the actual API capabilities and the requirements of the system.
