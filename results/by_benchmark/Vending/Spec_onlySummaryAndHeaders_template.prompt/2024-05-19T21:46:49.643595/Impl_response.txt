To define predicates for a vending machine in a Temporal Stream Logic (TSL) template, I will provide an `always assume` block to set the environment constraints and an `always guarantee` block to define the system's behavior. Here, we will only focus on the definitions of predicates as per your specified conditions and requirements.

### TSL Template

```tsl
always assume {
    // Predicates for checking the total amount in the vending machine
    (isLessThanPoint75(total) <-> (total < 0.75));
    (isLessThanOne(total) <-> (total < 1));
    (isLessThanOnePoint25(total) <-> (total < 1.25));

    // Predicates for checking key presses 
    (pressD(e) <-> (e.key === 'd'));
    (pressQ(e) <-> (e.key === 'q'));
    (pressO(e) <-> (e.key === 'o'));
    (press1(e) <-> (e.key === '1'));
    (press2(e) <-> (e.key === '2'));
    (press3(e) <-> (e.key === '3'));
    (pressR(e) <-> (e.key === 'r'));
}

always guarantee {
    // System behavior descriptions based on the predicates could be added here
    // For example, if a 'd' key is pressed, something happens
    pressD(e) -> [action <- performSomeAction];
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Variables Setup:**
   - `total` represents the state of the total money inserted into the vending machine.
   - `e` represents an event input from outside, particularly keypress events.

2. **Predicates Definitions:**
   - `isLessThanPoint75(total)`, `isLessThanOne(total)`, and `isLessThanOnePoint25(total)` are predicates defined to check if the total is less than specific values (0.75, 1, and 1.25 respectively).
   - `pressD(e)`, `pressQ(e)`, `pressO(e)`, `press1(e)`, `press2(e)`, `press3(e)`, and `pressR(e)` detect if specific keys are pressed by comparing the key attribute of event `e` with the respective character.

3. **System Guarantees:**
   - The `always guarantee` block can be used to define actions based on the predicates. For instance, if the 'd' key is pressed, a certain action is triggered in the system. These actions are conceptual and should correspond to actual functions or methods in the system's API.

This TSL template is a conceptual representation. The predicates will help in designing the logic flow of the vending machine system, making it robust and responsive to the inputs received from the user.
