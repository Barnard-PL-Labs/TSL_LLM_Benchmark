Given the requirements and predicates, we can model the behavior of the vending machine using Temporal Stream Logic (TSL) based on the predicates provided. Below, I'll write the corresponding TSL template for each predicate based on the description given for the vending machine system.

### TSL Template for the Vending Machine System

```tsl
always assume {
    // Define the conditions for key presses
    !(pressD(e) && (pressQ(e) || pressO(e) || press1(e) || press2(e) || press3(e) || pressR(e)));
    !(pressQ(e) && (pressD(e) || pressO(e) || press1(e) || press2(e) || press3(e) || pressR(e)));
    !(pressO(e) && (pressD(e) || pressQ(e) || press1(e) || press2(e) || press3(e) || pressR(e)));
    !(press1(e) && (pressD(e) || pressQ(e) || pressO(e) || press2(e) || press3(e) || pressR(e)));
    !(press2(e) && (pressD(e) || pressQ(e) || pressO(e) || press1(e) || press3(e) || pressR(e)));
    !(press3(e) && (pressD(e) || pressQ(e) || pressO(e) || press1(e) || press2(e) || pressR(e)));
    !(pressR(e) && (pressD(e) || pressQ(e) || pressO(e) || press1(e) || press2(e) || press3(e)));
}

always guarantee {
    // Define conditions under which certain keys are enabled based on total value
    isLessThanPoint75(total) -> (!press1(e) && !press2(e) && !press3(e));
    isLessThanOne(total) -> (!press2(e) && !press3(e));
    isLessThanOnePoint25(total) -> (!press3(e));

    // Define actions based on key presses
    pressD(e) -> [command <- dispenseDrink];
    pressQ(e) -> [command <- dispenseSnack];
    pressR(e) -> [command <- refund];
    pressO(e) -> [command <- openDoor];
    press1(e) -> [command <- selectOption1];
    press2(e) -> [command <- selectOption2];
    press3(e) -> [command <- selectOption3];
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Assumptions**:
   - Each key press is mutually exclusive with all other key presses. This prevents conflicting commands from being processed at the same time.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - Depending on the total amount in the vending machine, certain options (pressing 1, 2, or 3) are disabled, ensuring that operations not allowed by the current credit are impossible.
   - Each key press triggers a corresponding action, specified by modifying the `command` cell.

This TSL representation effectively describes the behavior of the vending machine based on the predicates you've identified. Note that in a real implementation, each predicate like `pressD(e)` would correspond to checking whether the 'D' key is pressed at that moment, which would be implemented in the actual vending machine's control software.
