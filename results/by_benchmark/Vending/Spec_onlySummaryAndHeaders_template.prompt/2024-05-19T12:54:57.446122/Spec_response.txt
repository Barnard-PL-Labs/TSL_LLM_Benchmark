Below is the TSL specification that represents the described behavior of a vending machine controlled by different button presses, which influence the total dollar amount and enable specific actions based on that total.

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure that no two machine operations (button presses) can occur at the same time
  !(press1(e) && press2(e));
  !(press1(e) && press3(e));
  !(press1(e) && pressD(e));
  !(press1(e) && pressQ(e));
  !(press1(e) && pressO(e));
  !(press1(e) && pressR(e));
  !(press2(e) && press3(e));
  !(press2(e) && pressD(e));
  !(press2(e) && pressQ(e));
  !(press2(e) && pressO(e));
  !(press2(e) && pressR(e));
  !(press3(e) && pressD(e));
  !(press3(e) && pressQ(e));
  !(press3(e) && pressO(e));
  !(press3(e) && pressR(e));
  !(pressD(e) && pressQ(e));
  !(pressD(e) && pressO(e));
  !(pressD(e) && pressR(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && pressO(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && pressR(e));
  !(pressO(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Increase total by 0.10 when 'd' is pressed
  pressD(e) -> [total <- total + 0.10];
  
  // Increase total by 0.25 when 'q' is pressed
  pressQ(e) -> [total <- total + 0.25];
  
  // Increase total by 1.00 when 'o' is pressed
  pressO(e) -> [total <- total + 1.00];
  
  // Set total to 0 when 'r' is pressed (refund)
  pressR(e) -> [total <- 0];
  
  // Check if enough money is inserted to buy product 1, product 2, and product 3
  // Product 1 can be purchased for $0.75 or more
  (press1(e) && isLessThanPoint75(total)) -> [total <- total - 0.75];
  
  // Product 2 can be purchased for $1.00 or more
  (press2(e) && isLessThanOne(total)) -> [total <- total - 1.00];
  
  // Product 3 can be purchased for $1.25 or more
  (press3(e) && isLessThanOnePoint25(total)) -> [total <- total - 1.25];
}
```

This TSL specification assumes that no two buttons can be pressed at the same time and defines the effect of each button press on the `total` cell, which tracks the amount of money entered into the vending machine. Button presses either increase the `total` or, in the case of product selections, decrease it by the cost of the selected product if the current total meets the necessary threshold. The actions for purchasing products are only executed if the total amount meets or exceeds the required amounts after checking the conditions.
