To implement the specified predicates in Temporal Stream Logic (TSL) for a vending machine scenario where certain actions are dependent on the state of inputs, you can follow these patterns in the TSL template. Since you have asked to avoid implementing any functions and instead use predicates, here's how the predicates could be structured according to the requirements. Note that TSL itself does not directly implement JavaScript functions but rather defines logical conditions and reactions over time using provided predicates.

```tsl
always assume {
    // Predicates determining if the total is less than specific amounts
    isLessThanPoint75(total) -> (total < 0.75);
    isLessThanOne(total) -> (total < 1);
    isLessThanOnePoint25(total) -> (total < 1.25);

    // Predicates determining if specific keys are pressed
    pressD(e) -> (e.key == 'd');
    pressQ(e) -> (e.key == 'q');
    pressO(e) -> (e.key == 'o');
    press1(e) -> (e.key == '1');
    press2(e) -> (e.key == '2');
    press3(e) -> (e.key == '3');
    pressR(e) -> (e.key == 'r');
}

always guarantee {
    // Usage of predicates could be defined here based on the system's need. For example:
    // If 'd' is pressed and total is less than 0.75, some action can be triggered
    pressD(e) && isLessThanPoint75(total) -> [action <- triggerSomeAction];

    // Similarly, other combinations can enforce different behaviors:
    pressQ(e) && isLessThanOne(total) -> [action <- anotherAction];
    pressO(e) && isLessThanOnePoint25(total) -> [action <- yetAnotherAction];
}
```

Please note the following:
- `action <- triggerSomeAction` represent hypothetical actions that could be performed in the system. Replace these with actual actions suitable for your system.
- The predicates are used in assume and guarantee blocks to specify what the system assumes to be true about its inputs and what it guarantees to do in response to those inputs.
- The actual implementation of checking conditions like `total < 0.75` or `e.key == 'd'` would depend on the system's underlying implementation and integration of TSL. The above syntax is illustrative based on typical usage in TSL descriptions.

This TSL description sets the basic framework for handling inputs and making decisions based on those inputs in a vending machine scenario. Adjustments and expansions can be made based on detailed system requirements and the specific conditions and actions required.
