Below is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description of the vending machine operations, using the given functions and predicates:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Restrict the operation so that no two machine operations can be performed simultaneously
  !(press1(e) && press2(e));
  !(press1(e) && press3(e));
  !(press1(e) && pressD(e));
  !(press1(e) && pressQ(e));
  !(press1(e) && pressO(e));
  !(press1(e) && pressR(e));
  !(press2(e) && press3(e));
  !(press2(e) && pressD(e));
  !(press2(e) && pressQ(e));
  !(press2(e) && pressO(e));
  !(press2(e) && pressR(e));
  !(press3(e) && pressD(e));
  !(press3(e) && pressQ(e));
  !(press3(e) && pressO(e));
  !(press3(e) && pressR(e));
  !(pressD(e) && pressQ(e));
  !(pressD(e) && pressO(e));
  !(pressD(e) && pressR(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && pressO(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && pressR(e));
  !(pressO(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Operations for the vending machine based on the button pressed and the total amount available
  press1(e) && isLessThanPoint75(total) -> [e <- dispenseOption1()];
  press2(e) && isLessThanOne(total) -> [e <- dispenseOption2()];
  press3(e) && isLessThanOnePoint25(total) -> [e <- dispenseOption3()];

  // Operations for inserting money into the vending machine
  pressD(e) -> [total <- total + 0.10]; // Inserting a dime
  pressQ(e) -> [total <- total + 0.25]; // Inserting a quarter
  pressO(e) -> [total <- total + 1.00]; // Inserting a dollar

  // Operation for refunding the money
  pressR(e) -> [total <- 0]; // Refunding

  // Ensure total is correctly updated based on the operation performed
  press1(e) -> [total <- total - 0.75];
  press2(e) -> [total <- total - 1.00];
  press3(e) -> [total <- total - 1.25];
}
```

This TSL specification accurately reflects the vending machine operations where each button press results in a corresponding action, such as dispensing a product or inserting money, based on the conditions of the total amount available and also ensures that no two operations can be performed at the same time. Adjustments in the total are made after dispensing the products.
