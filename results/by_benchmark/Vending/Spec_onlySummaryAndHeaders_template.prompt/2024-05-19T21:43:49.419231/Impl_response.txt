To create TSL predicates based on the given instructions, we need to define expressions that evaluate to boolean values based on the state of the signals `total` and `e`. Let's define the predicates in the TSL environment for the vending machine system using the natural language description provided:

```plaintext
always assume {
    // Define the relationship between the 'total' cell and the monetary check predicates
    (total < 0.75) <-> isLessThanPoint75(total);
    (total < 1) <-> isLessThanOne(total);
    (total < 1.25) <-> isLessThanOnePoint25(total);

    // Define the relationship between 'e' cell and the key press predicates
    (pressD(e)) <-> (e == 'D');
    (pressQ(e)) <-> (e == 'Q');
    (pressO(e)) <-> (e == 'O');
    (press1(e)) <-> (e == '1');
    (press2(e)) <-> (e == '2');
    (press3(e)) <-> (e == '3');
    (pressR(e)) <-> (e == 'R');
}
always guarantee {
    // There may be additional system guarantees to define based on further requirements
    // These would define the system's responses or constraints triggered by the predicates
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Predicates with `total`:**
   - `isLessThanPoint75(total)`, `isLessThanOne(total)`, and `isLessThanOnePoint25(total)` are defined to directly relate to the value of the `total` cell and compare it against specific monetary thresholds (0.75, 1, and 1.25 respectively).

2. **Predicates with `e`:**
   - Each predicate like `pressD(e)`, `pressQ(e)`, etc., is linked to the `e` signal representing a key press. The predicate checks if the corresponding key ('D', 'Q', 'O', '1', '2', '3', 'R') is the current state of `e`.

3. **Guarantee Section:**
   - The `always guarantee` section is left intentionally vague as the specific actions or responses of the vending machine (such as dispensing items, returning change, etc.) need more detail about the system requirements and possible states to define appropriate guarantees.

This TSL setup ensures that the assumptions about user inputs (monetary values and key presses) are correctly captured and can be used to define system behaviors (not specified in the query) in response to these inputs.
