Here's the TSL specification for the vending machine based on the provided description and functions:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure that no two buttons are pressed simultaneously
  !(pressD(e) && pressQ(e));
  !(pressD(e) && pressO(e));
  !(pressD(e) && pressR(e));
  !(pressD(e) && press1(e));
  !(pressD(e) && press2(e));
  !(pressD(e) && press3(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && pressO(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && pressR(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && press1(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && press2(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && press3(e));
  !(pressO(e) && pressR(e));
  !(pressO(e) && press1(e));
  !(pressO(e) && press2(e));
  !(pressO(e) && press3(e));
  !(pressR(e) && press1(e));
  !(pressR(e) && press2(e));
  !(pressR(e) && press3(e));
  !(press1(e) && press2(e));
  !(press1(e) && press3(e));
  !(press2(e) && press3(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Adding money to the machine
  pressD(e) -> [total <- total + 0.10];
  pressQ(e) -> [total <- total + 0.25];
  pressO(e) -> [total <- total + 1.00];

  // Product purchases
  (press1(e) && !isLessThanPoint75(total)) -> [total <- total - 0.75];
  (press2(e) && !isLessThanOne(total)) -> [total <- total - 1.00];
  (press3(e) && !isLessThanOnePoint25(total)) -> [total <- total - 1.25];

  // Refunding money
  pressR(e) -> [total <- 0];
}
```

This TSL specification models a vending machine that reacts to button presses by either adding money to the total, dispensing products, or refunding the total amount. Note that conditions for dispensing products ensure that the total is sufficient before the product can be purchased, reducing the total by the product's cost if the condition holds. The mutual exclusion of button presses is also ensured to prevent simultaneous operations.
