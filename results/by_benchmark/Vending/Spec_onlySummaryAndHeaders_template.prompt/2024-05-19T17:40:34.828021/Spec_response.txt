Below is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description for the operations of a vending machine system:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure no two buttons are pressed simultaneously
  !(pressD(e) && pressQ(e));
  !(pressD(e) && pressO(e));
  !(pressD(e) && pressR(e));
  !(pressD(e) && press1(e));
  !(pressD(e) && press2(e));
  !(pressD(e) && press3(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && pressO(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && pressR(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && press1(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && press2(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && press3(e));
  !(pressO(e) && pressR(e));
  !(pressO(e) && press1(e));
  !(pressO(e) && press2(e));
  !(pressO(e) && press3(e));
  !(pressR(e) && press1(e));
  !(pressR(e) && press2(e));
  !(pressR(e) && press3(e));
  !(press1(e) && press2(e));
  !(press1(e) && press3(e));
  !(press2(e) && press3(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Insert a dime by pressing 'd'
  pressD(e) -> [total <- total + 0.10];

  // Insert a quarter by pressing 'q'
  pressQ(e) -> [total <- total + 0.25];

  // Insert a dollar by pressing 'o'
  pressO(e) -> [total <- total + 1.00];

  // Refund money by pressing 'r'
  pressR(e) -> [total <- 0];

  // Purchasing product option 1 (requires $0.75 or more)
  (!isLessThanPoint75(total) && press1(e)) -> [total <- total - 0.75];

  // Purchasing product option 2 (requires $1 or more)
  (!isLessThanOne(total) && press2(e)) -> [total <- total - 1.00];

  // Purchasing product option 3 (requires $1.25 or more)
  (!isLessThanOnePoint25(total) && press3(e)) -> [total <- total - 1.25];
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Assumptions**: The specification assumes that no two operations can be executed simultaneously, which ensures mutual exclusion between button presses.

2. **Guarantees**: 
   - It handles increments of the total amount in the vending machine when coins or bills are inserted (`d`, `q`, `o`).
   - It allows a refund operation that sets the total amount to zero when `r` is pressed.
   - It checks the available total and subtracts the appropriate amount for each product purchase, only if the total amount meets the required thresholds for each product (`1`, `2`, `3`).

This specification effectively models the operations and constraints of the vending machine based on the functions and predicates provided.
