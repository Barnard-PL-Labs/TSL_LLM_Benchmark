To implement the predicates you've described, I'll write them in Temporal Stream Logic (TSL) format. This will involve mapping the predicates to specific conditions and checks to manage the state of the vending machine based on the inputs.

Hereâ€™s how the TSL template could be structured for the predicates given:

```tsl
always assume {
    // Assuming the API provides these methods directly
    total < 0.75;
    total < 1;
    total < 1.25;
    pressD(e);
    pressQ(e);
    pressO(e);
    press1(e);
    press2(e);
    press3(e);
    pressR(e);
}

always guarantee {
    // Define the behavior based on the predicates
    isLessThanPoint75(total) -> total < 0.75;
    isLessThanOne(total)     -> total < 1;
    isLessThanOnePoint25(total) -> total < 1.25;
    pressD(e) -> pressD(e);
    pressQ(e) -> pressQ(e);
    pressO(e) -> pressO(e);
    press1(e) -> press1(e);
    press2(e) -> press2(e);
    press3(e) -> press3(e);
    pressR(e) -> pressR(e);
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions**: This section assumes the existence of inputs or environmental signals, which can be the state of the `total` or specific key presses. Each predicate you described is represented as a condition that evaluates true if the associated condition is met.

2. **Guarantees**: This section ensures that specific actions or outputs are enforced based on the conditions described in the predicates. For instance, `isLessThanPoint75(total)` is true if `total < 0.75`, aligning with the description of the predicates.

This structure allows for a clear representation of conditions and actions based on the inputs and internal state (like the total amount in the vending machine). By maintaining separation between assumptions and guarantees, the system can be more predictable and easier to debug or verify against specified behaviors.
