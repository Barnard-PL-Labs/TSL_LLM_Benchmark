Based on the given natural language description and the predicates and actions listed, here's how you could formulate the TSL specification for the vending machine operation:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure no two machine operations can be performed at the same time
  !(press1(e) && press2(e)) && !(press1(e) && press3(e)) && !(press1(e) && pressD(e)) && !(press1(e) && pressQ(e)) && !(press1(e) && pressO(e)) && !(press1(e) && pressR(e));
  !(press2(e) && press3(e)) && !(press2(e) && pressD(e)) && !(press2(e) && pressQ(e)) && !(press2(e) && pressO(e)) && !(press2(e) && pressR(e));
  !(press3(e) && pressD(e)) && !(press3(e) && pressQ(e)) && !(press3(e) && pressO(e)) && !(press3(e) && pressR(e));
  !(pressD(e) && pressQ(e)) && !(pressD(e) && pressO(e)) && !(pressD(e) && pressR(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && pressO(e)) && !(pressQ(e) && pressR(e));
  !(pressO(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Product purchasing conditions based on the total dollar amount
  press1(e) -> (!isLessThanPoint75(total));
  press2(e) -> (!isLessThanOne(total));
  press3(e) -> (!isLessThanOnePoint25(total));

  // Inserting money into the machine
  pressD(e) -> ([total <- total + 0.10]);
  pressQ(e) -> ([total <- total + 0.25]);
  pressO(e) -> ([total <- total + 1.00]);

  // Refunding the money
  pressR(e) -> ([total <- 0]);
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions:** The assumption block ensures mutual exclusion between any two operations, ensuring that no two operations occur simultaneously.
   
2. **Guarantees:** 
   - **Product Purchases:** Activating the purchase buttons (1, 2, 3) are conditioned on having enough money in `total`. It checks that the `total` is not less than a specific amount before allowing the purchase. This is translated from the given predicates which inform if the total is less than a certain amount. We use the negation to ensure the total must be greater or equal to the required amount.
   - **Money Insertion:** Each button press associated with money insertion increments the `total` by the respective amount of the currency added (dime = 0.10, quarter = 0.25, dollar = 1.00).
   - **Refund:** Pressing the 'r' key sets the total back to zero.

This specification captures the behavior of a simple vending machine managing its transactions based on user inputs with constraints on concurrent operations.
