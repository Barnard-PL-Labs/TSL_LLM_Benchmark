Based on the natural language description provided, here's how the TSL specification for the vending machine scenario could be structured:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure that no two machine operations can be performed at the same time
  !(press1(e) && press2(e));
  !(press1(e) && press3(e));
  !(press1(e) && pressD(e));
  !(press1(e) && pressQ(e));
  !(press1(e) && pressO(e));
  !(press1(e) && pressR(e));
  !(press2(e) && press3(e));
  !(press2(e) && pressD(e));
  !(press2(e) && pressQ(e));
  !(press2(e) && pressO(e));
  !(press2(e) && pressR(e));
  !(press3(e) && pressD(e));
  !(press3(e) && pressQ(e));
  !(press3(e) && pressO(e));
  !(press3(e) && pressR(e));
  !(pressD(e) && pressQ(e));
  !(pressD(e) && pressO(e));
  !(pressD(e) && pressR(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && pressO(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && pressR(e));
  !(pressO(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Purchasing product options 1, 2, and 3 with the conditions on the total amount
  press1(e) && isLessThanPoint75(total) -> [total <- total - 0.75];
  press2(e) && isLessThanOne(total) -> [total <- total - 1];
  press3(e) && isLessThanOnePoint25(total) -> [total <- total - 1.25];

  // Inserting money into the machine
  pressD(e) -> [total <- total + 0.10];  // Inserting a dime
  pressQ(e) -> [total <- total + 0.25];  // Inserting a quarter
  pressO(e) -> [total <- total + 1.00];  // Inserting a dollar

  // Refunding the money
  pressR(e) -> [total <- 0];  // Resetting the total to 0
}
```

This TSL specification adheres to the natural language description by ensuring that each button press leads to a corresponding action while maintaining that no two operations can occur simultaneously. The `always assume` block enforces mutual exclusion between different button presses, and the `always guarantee` block specifies the changes in the system state based on the button pressed and the conditions specified.
