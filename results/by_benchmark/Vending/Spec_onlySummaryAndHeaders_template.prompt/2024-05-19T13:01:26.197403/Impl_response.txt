Given the scenario and the requirement for creating predicates in TSL (Temporal Stream Logic) based on the descriptions provided, we can model the system predicates for a vending machine interface. Here, each predicate will be described in terms of TSL expressions. Since TSL is typically used for temporal logic specification, the predicates here will be expressed in a way that they can be used within TSL environments, assuming the existence of an API or system interface for detecting key presses and checking amounts. However, actual implementation details such as function definitions in JavaScript or any other programming language are not provided as per your instruction not to use or implement any functions.

### TSL Template for the Vending Machine System

```tsl
always assume {
    // Assumptions on the nature of the 'total' and 'e' signals
    // These are imaginary bindings and should be adapted to actual system properties
    (total >= 0);
    (e >= 0);
}

always guarantee {
    // Definitions of predicates based on the cell 'total'
    isLessThanPoint75(total) := total < 0.75;
    isLessThanOne(total) := total < 1.00;
    isLessThanOnePoint25(total) := total < 1.25;

    // Definitions of predicates based on the cell 'e' representing key presses
    pressD(e) := e == 'D';   // Assuming 'e' indicates the last key pressed
    pressQ(e) := e == 'Q';   // Likewise
    pressO(e) := e == 'O';   // Likewise
    press1(e) := e == '1';   // Likewise
    press2(e) := e == '2';   // Likewise
    press3(e) := e == '3';   // Likewise
    pressR(e) := e == 'R';   // Likewise
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Assumptions**: 
    - The `always assume` block contains assumptions about the signals `total` and `e`. It assumes that `total` is always non-negative, which is a typical scenario for a total amount in a vending machine.
    - The `e` signal is checked against various key values, assuming that `e` represents some form of input where the last key pressed is stored.

2. **Guarantees**:
    - The `always guarantee` block defines the predicates. Each predicate is a simple comparison or equality check, designed to return a boolean value.
    - For example, `isLessThanPoint75(total)` checks if the total amount is less than 0.75. This can be used to determine if enough money has been inserted for a particular item.
    - `pressD(e)` checks if the 'D' key was pressed, which might correspond to a command or selection in the vending machine interface.

### Usage:

These TSL predicates can be used as part of a broader TSL specification to govern the behavior of a vending machine system, ensuring that actions are taken based on the state of the inputs and maintained conditions throughout the operation of the machine. This specification can be integrated into a formal verification environment or used to generate monitors for a real-time system controlling a vending machine.
