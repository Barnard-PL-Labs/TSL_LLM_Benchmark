Here is the TSL specification based on the provided natural language description and the framework:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure that no two operations can occur at the same time
  !(press1(e) && press2(e));
  !(press1(e) && press3(e));
  !(press1(e) && pressD(e));
  !(press1(e) && pressQ(e));
  !(press1(e) && pressO(e));
  !(press1(e) && pressR(e));

  !(press2(e) && press3(e));
  !(press2(e) && pressD(e));
  !(press2(e) && pressQ(e));
  !(press2(e) && pressO(e));
  !(press2(e) && pressR(e));

  !(press3(e) && pressD(e));
  !(press3(e) && pressQ(e));
  !(press3(e) && pressO(e));
  !(press3(e) && pressR(e));

  !(pressD(e) && pressQ(e));
  !(pressD(e) && pressO(e));
  !(pressD(e) && pressR(e));

  !(pressQ(e) && pressO(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && pressR(e));

  !(pressO(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Define the behavior for each button press according to the total
  press1(e) && !isLessThanPoint75(total) -> [total <- total - 0.75];
  press2(e) && !isLessThanOne(total) -> [total <- total - 1.00];
  press3(e) && !isLessThanOnePoint25(total) -> [total <- total - 1.25];
  pressD(e) -> [total <- total + 0.10];
  pressQ(e) -> [total <- total + 0.25];
  pressO(e) -> [total <- total + 1.00];
  pressR(e) -> [total <- 0];
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Assume Block**: Mutual exclusivity is assumed such that no two operations can occur simultaneously, ensuring that the vending machine processes one input at a time.
2. **Guarantee Block**:
   - For product purchases (keys 1, 2, 3), the machine checks whether the total inserted money is sufficient (`isLessThanPoint75`, `isLessThanOne`, `isLessThanOnePoint25` used inversely to check if the total is greater or equal to the required amount).
   - Money insertion operations (keys d, q, o) add the respective amounts to the total.
   - The refund operation (key r) resets the total to zero.

This TSL specification considers the operations that can be performed on the vending machine and ensures that these actions are mutually exclusive, with appropriate modifications to the total amount based on the user's input.
