To implement the specified predicates in TSL (Temporal Stream Logic) for a vending machine system, we need to define assumptions about the environment and guarantees about how the system will react to those inputs. Let's go ahead and describe these predicates in TSL format:

### TSL Template for Vending Machine System

```plaintext
always assume {
  // Definitions of environmental inputs regarding the 'total' and 'e' cells
  // These would be typical assumptions about how 'total' and 'e' are set, but in this case,
  // we will focus on the predicates without defining explicit assumptions.
}

always guarantee {
  // Predicate: isLessThanPoint75(total)
  // This will be true if the 'total' is less than 0.75
  isLessThanPoint75(total) <-> (total < 0.75);

  // Predicate: isLessThanOne(total)
  // This will be true if the 'total' is less than 1
  isLessThanOne(total) <-> (total < 1);

  // Predicate: isLessThanOnePoint25(total)
  // This will be true if the 'total' is less than 1.25
  isLessThanOnePoint25(total) <-> (total < 1.25);

  // Predicate: pressD(e)
  // This will be true if the 'e' cell indicates the user pressed the 'd' key
  pressD(e) <-> (e == 'd');

  // Predicate: pressQ(e)
  // This will be true if the 'e' cell indicates the user pressed the 'q' key
  pressQ(e) <-> (e == 'q');

  // Predicate: pressO(e)
  // This will be true if the 'e' cell indicates the user pressed the 'o' key
  pressO(e) <-> (e == 'o');

  // Predicate: press1(e)
  // This will be true if the 'e' cell indicates the user pressed the '1' key
  press1(e) <-> (e == '1');

  // Predicate: press2(e)
  // This will be true if the 'e' cell indicates the user pressed the '2' key
  press2(e) <-> (e == '2');

  // Predicate: press3(e)
  // This will be true if the 'e' cell indicates the user pressed the '3' key
  press3(e) <-> (e == '3');

  // Predicate: pressR(e)
  // This will be true if the 'e' cell indicates the user pressed the 'r' key
  pressR(e) <-> (e == 'r');
}
```

### Explanation

In this TSL template:
- **`always assume`**: Here we could define how 'total' and 'e' are expected to behave over time. However, since we're focused on the predicates themselves, there are no explicit assumptions provided.
- **`always guarantee`**: This section defines the relationship between the state of 'total' and 'e', and the predicates we want to implement. Each predicate is represented as a logical equivalence (`<->`), indicating that the predicate holds true if and only if the condition on the right-hand side of the equivalence is true. This ensures that the TSL system correctly understands and reacts based on the predicate's definition.
