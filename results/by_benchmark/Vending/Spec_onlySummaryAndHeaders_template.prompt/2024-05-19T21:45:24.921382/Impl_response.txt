To implement the predicates listed above using Temporal Stream Logic (TSL), you need to define the predicates and signals as per the provided descriptions about the `total` and `e` cells. Here, we do not write JavaScript functions or use an API wrapper but rather express these conditions directly in TSL format. 

Here is how you can represent the predicates in TSL:

```tsl
always assume {
    // Defining the state of the 'total' cell in terms of various conditions
    isLessThanPoint75(total) -> (total < 0.75);
    isLessThanOne(total) -> (total < 1);
    isLessThanOnePoint25(total) -> (total < 1.25);
    
    // Defining the state of the 'e' cell based on user's key presses
    pressD(e) -> (e == 'd');
    pressQ(e) -> (e == 'q');
    pressO(e) -> (e == 'o');
    press1(e) -> (e == '1');
    press2(e) -> (e == '2');
    press3(e) -> (e == '3');
    pressR(e) -> (e == 'r');
}

always guarantee {
    // As per the problem statement, no functions are to be implemented, and no specific behavior is needed in response to the signals.
    // Add behavior guarantees here if required later.
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions**:
   - The `assume` block defines the conditions or interpretation of signals from the environment (or the internal state of the system).
   - Each predicate function checks the state of the `total` or `e` and returns a boolean based on the comparison or condition specified.

2. **Guarantees**:
   - In the `guarantee` block, you would specify how the system should respond based on the assumptions defined. However, since the task does not specify any actions or outputs in response to these predicates, this section remains empty or could include placeholders for future behavior requirements.

3. **Signals and Conditions**:
   - `total` and `e` are treated as inputs or signals whose values are checked against certain conditions (like checking if `total` is less than 0.75 or if the 'd' key was pressed).
   - These implementations align with using TSL for defining system behaviors and constraints based on temporal logic, focusing on how conditions evolve or are maintained over time.
