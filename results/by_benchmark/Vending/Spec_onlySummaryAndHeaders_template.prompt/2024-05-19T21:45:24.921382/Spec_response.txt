Here's the TSL specification based on the natural language description of the vending machine operations:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure mutual exclusion between different button presses
  !(pressD(e) && pressQ(e));
  !(pressD(e) && pressO(e));
  !(pressD(e) && pressR(e));
  !(pressD(e) && press1(e));
  !(pressD(e) && press2(e));
  !(pressD(e) && press3(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && pressO(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && pressR(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && press1(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && press2(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && press3(e));
  !(pressO(e) && pressR(e));
  !(pressO(e) && press1(e));
  !(pressO(e) && press2(e));
  !(pressO(e) && press3(e));
  !(pressR(e) && press1(e));
  !(pressR(e) && press2(e));
  !(pressR(e) && press3(e));
  !(press1(e) && press2(e));
  !(press1(e) && press3(e));
  !(press2(e) && press3(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Inserting a dime increases total by 0.10
  pressD(e) -> [total <- total + 0.10];
  
  // Inserting a quarter increases total by 0.25
  pressQ(e) -> [total <- total + 0.25];
  
  // Inserting a dollar increases total by 1.00
  pressO(e) -> [total <- total + 1.00];

  // Refunding money sets total to 0
  pressR(e) -> [total <- 0];

  // Purchasing product option 1 decreases total by 0.75 if total >= 0.75
  press1(e) && !isLessThanPoint75(total) -> [total <- total - 0.75];
  
  // Purchasing product option 2 decreases total by 1.00 if total >= 1
  press2(e) && !isLessThanOne(total) -> [total <- total - 1.00];

  // Purchasing product option 3 decreases total by 1.25 if total >= 1.25
  press3(e) && !isLessThanOnePoint25(total) -> [total <- total - 1.25];
}
```

This TSL specification ensures that the vending machine operations only occur when the corresponding button is pressed and the conditions related to the total amount are satisfied. It also ensures that no two operations can be executed simultaneously through mutual exclusion of button presses.
