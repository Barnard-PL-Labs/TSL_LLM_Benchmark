Given the information that `total` and `e` are cell states, and based on JavaScript capabilities for handling such predicates, we would generally implement these predicates as functions. However, since we are directed not to use any "functions" and instead to model this in a TSL template, hereâ€™s how we would express these predicates in a TSL environment as assumptions or guarantees. 

We'll assume that `total` and `e` are signals provided by the environment, and we will define the conditions under which each predicate holds true. 

```tsl
always assume {
    // Definitions for "total" comparisons
    isLessThanPoint75: total < 0.75;
    isLessThanOne: total < 1;
    isLessThanOnePoint25: total < 1.25;
    
    // Definitions for "e" keypresses
    pressD: e == 'd';
    pressQ: e == 'q';
    pressO: e == 'o';
    press1: e == '1';
    press2: e == '2';
    press3: e == '3';
    pressR: e == 'r';
}

always guarantee {
    // This section would define the system's response to the predicates, but since we are not to implement functions, it remains empty.
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions (`always assume {...}`)**: This section is used to define the conditions (predicates) from the environment's signals. Here, each line translates the predicate definitions into conditions that relate to the `total` or `e` signals. For example, `isLessThanPoint75: total < 0.75;` assumes that the predicate `isLessThanPoint75` becomes true when `total` signal is less than `0.75`. Similarly, predicates for key presses are translated into conditions checking if `e` equals specific characters.

2. **Guarantees (`always guarantee {...}`)**: This section is typically used to describe how the system should behave based on the inputs from the environment. However, since you specified not to implement any functions or further actions, this part remains empty.

### Notes:
- Direct function implementations (e.g., `function isLessThanPoint75(total) { return total < 0.75; }`) were avoided per your instructions.
- Typically, handling such predicates in a real JavaScript environment would involve functions, but here it's modeled in TSL to reflect environmental conditions and potential system reactions.
