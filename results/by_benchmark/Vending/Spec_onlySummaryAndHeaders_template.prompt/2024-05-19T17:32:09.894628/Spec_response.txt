Below is the TSL specification based on the provided description of a vending machine operation interface:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Mutual exclusion for button presses, to ensure no two operations can happen at the same time
  !(press1(e) && press2(e));
  !(press1(e) && press3(e));
  !(press1(e) && pressD(e));
  !(press1(e) && pressQ(e));
  !(press1(e) && pressO(e));
  !(press1(e) && pressR(e));
  !(press2(e) && press3(e));
  !(press2(e) && pressD(e));
  !(press2(e) && pressQ(e));
  !(press2(e) && pressO(e));
  !(press2(e) && pressR(e));
  !(press3(e) && pressD(e));
  !(press3(e) && pressQ(e));
  !(press3(e) && pressO(e));
  !(press3(e) && pressR(e));
  !(pressD(e) && pressQ(e));
  !(pressD(e) && pressO(e));
  !(pressD(e) && pressR(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && pressO(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && pressR(e));
  !(pressO(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Purchasing operations are contingent on having enough total in the machine
  (press1(e) && !isLessThanPoint75(total)) -> [total <- total - 0.75];
  (press2(e) && !isLessThanOne(total)) -> [total <- total - 1.00];
  (press3(e) && !isLessThanOnePoint25(total)) -> [total <- total - 1.25];

  // Inserting money into the machine by pressing d, q, or o
  pressD(e) -> [total <- total + 0.10]; // Dime
  pressQ(e) -> [total <- total + 0.25]; // Quarter
  pressO(e) -> [total <- total + 1.00]; // Dollar

  // Refunding money
  pressR(e) -> [total <- 0]; // Reset total to zero
}
```

This TSL specification outlines the behavior of the vending machine based on user interactions through button presses. It ensures that actions such as purchasing products and inserting money are exclusive and depend on specific conditions, e.g., having sufficient credit in the machine. It also covers the refund operation by resetting the total amount collected when the refund button (r) is pressed.
