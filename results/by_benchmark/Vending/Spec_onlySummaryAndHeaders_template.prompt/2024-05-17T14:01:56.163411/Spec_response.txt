Here's a TSL (Temporal Stream-based Specification Language) specific code based on the natural language description provided:

```tsl
always assume {
    // Ensure no two machine operations occur simultaneously
    !(press1(e) && press2(e));
    !(press1(e) && press3(e));
    !(press1(e) && pressD(e));
    !(press1(e) && pressQ(e));
    !(press1(e) && pressO(e));
    !(press1(e) && pressR(e));
    !(press2(e) && press3(e));
    !(press2(e) && pressD(e));
    !(press2(e) && pressQ(e));
    !(press2(e) && pressO(e));
    !(press2(e) && pressR(e));
    !(press3(e) && pressD(e));
    !(press3(e) && pressQ(e));
    !(press3(e) && pressO(e));
    !(press3(e) && pressR(e));
    !(pressD(e) && pressQ(e));
    !(pressD(e) && pressO(e));
    !(pressD(e) && pressR(e));
    !(pressQ(e) && pressO(e));
    !(pressQ(e) && pressR(e));
    !(pressO(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
    // If the total is at least 0.75, allow the purchase of product option 1 (press1)
    (isLessThanPoint75(total) -> ![total <- total - 0.75]) W press1(e);
    // If the total is at least 1, allow the purchase of product option 2 (press2)
    (isLessThanOne(total) -> ![total <- total - 1]) W press2(e);
    // If the total is at least 1.25, allow the purchase of product option 3 (press3)
    (isLessThanOnePoint25(total) -> ![total <- total - 1.25]) W press3(e);

    // Operations for inserting money
    pressD(e) -> [total <- total + 0.10]; // Insert a dime
    pressQ(e) -> [total <- total + 0.25]; // Insert a quarter
    pressO(e) -> [total <- total + 1.00]; // Insert a dollar

    // Refund operation
    pressR(e) -> [total <- 0]; // Reset total to zero
}
```

### Notes:
1. Each `pressX(e)` function corresponds to a button press, where `X` can be `1`, `2`, `3`, `D` (dime), `Q` (quarter), `O` (one dollar), or `R` (refund).
2. The `isLessThanX` predicates check whether the current total in the machine meets the required threshold to perform certain operations like purchasing a product.
3. The `W` operator (weak until) used here allows for the continuation of the vending machine's operation until a particular button is pressed, ensuring the prerequisites are continuously satisfied.
4. The `always assume` block enforces mutual exclusion between operational commands, ensuring that no two operations happen simultaneously.
