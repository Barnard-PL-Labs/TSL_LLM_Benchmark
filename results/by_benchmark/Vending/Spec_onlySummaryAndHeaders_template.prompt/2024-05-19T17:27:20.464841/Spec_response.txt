To translate your natural language description into a TSL specification for a vending machine, we'll define assumptions and guarantees that ensure the vending machine behaves correctly based on button presses and the total amount inserted.

### TSL Specification

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure that only one button can be pressed at any given time (mutual exclusion)
  !(pressD(e) && pressQ(e)) &&
  !(pressD(e) && pressO(e)) &&
  !(pressD(e) && pressR(e)) &&
  !(pressD(e) && press1(e)) &&
  !(pressD(e) && press2(e)) &&
  !(pressD(e) && press3(e)) &&
  !(pressQ(e) && pressO(e)) &&
  !(pressQ(e) && pressR(e)) &&
  !(pressQ(e) && press1(e)) &&
  !(pressQ(e) && press2(e)) &&
  !(pressQ(e) && press3(e)) &&
  !(pressO(e) && pressR(e)) &&
  !(pressO(e) && press1(e)) &&
  !(pressO(e) && press2(e)) &&
  !(pressO(e) && press3(e)) &&
  !(pressR(e) && press1(e)) &&
  !(pressR(e) && press2(e)) &&
  !(pressR(e) && press3(e)) &&
  !(press1(e) && press2(e)) &&
  !(press1(e) && press3(e)) &&
  !(press2(e) && press3(e))
}

always guarantee {
  // Handle money insertion
  pressD(e) -> [total <- total + 0.10];
  pressQ(e) -> [total <- total + 0.25];
  pressO(e) -> [total <- total + 1.00];

  // Handle refunds
  pressR(e) -> [total <- 0];

  // Purchase products based on sufficient total amounts
  press1(e) && !isLessThanPoint75(total) -> [total <- total - 0.75];
  press2(e) && !isLessThanOne(total) -> [total <- total - 1];
  press3(e) && !isLessThanOnePoint25(total) -> [total <- total - 1.25];

  // Ensure operations do not overlap and respect the total constraints
  press1(e) -> !(press2(e) || press3(e) || pressR(e) || pressD(e) || pressQ(e) || pressO(e));
  press2(e) -> !(press1(e) || press3(e) || pressR(e) || pressD(e) || pressQ(e) || pressO(e));
  press3(e) -> !(press1(e) || press2(e) || pressR(e) || pressD(e) || pressQ(e) || pressO(e));
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions**: Ensure that no two buttons can be pressed simultaneously, which would cause conflicting operations.
2. **Guarantees**: Define the operations for each button press:
   - Incrementing the 'total' for each coin or bill inserted.
   - Setting the 'total' to zero when the refund button is pressed.
   - Deducting the appropriate amount from 'total' when a product is purchased, only if enough credit is available.
   - Ensuring that pressing a button for purchasing or refunding does not allow any other operation to occur simultaneously, respecting the constraints set by the available credit.

This specification assumes basic handling of the vending machine's operations based on the user's inputs and the conditions defined for each input's effect on the machine's state.
