To represent the given predicates within a Temporal Stream Logic (TSL) framework, you need to focus on defining logical conditions that involve the state of cells `total` and `e`, based on the requirements specified. Here, you can outline how the TSL template would look like for the vending machine, assuming certain predicates and actions based on the given conditions.

### TSL Template for the Vending Machine

```TSL
always assume {
    // Assumptions about the system's environment and predicate conditions
    // These conditions define the events that can occur based on user inputs and the 'total' cell state
    isLessThanPoint75(total) <-> (total < 0.75);
    isLessThanOne(total) <-> (total < 1);
    isLessThanOnePoint25(total) <-> (total < 1.25);
    pressD(e) <-> e == 'D';
    pressQ(e) <-> e == 'Q';
    pressO(e) <-> e == 'O';
    press1(e) <-> e == '1';
    press2(e) <-> e == '2';
    press3(e) <-> e == '3';
    pressR(e) <-> e == 'R';
}

always guarantee {
    // Guarantees define how the vending machine should act based on the predicates
    // For example, specific conditions can lead to actions like updating the total or dispensing items
    // Example actions (pseudo-code, not syntax specific):
    // if pressD(e) then [action <- dispenseDrink()]
    // if pressQ(e) then [action <- queryBalance()]
    // if pressR(e) && total >= 1.0 then [total <- total - 1.0] [action <- resetMachine()]
    
    // These actions are illustrative and should be adapted to specific machine capabilities and APIs
}
```

### Explanation
- **always assume**: This section specifies the conditions under which the predicates are true. It ties the predicates directly to conditions involving the cell `total` and the cell `e` that captures user inputs.
- **always guarantee**: This section would specify the actions of the vending machine based on the predicates. Actions such as dispensing items, adding to the total, or resetting the machine would be included here, contingent on the predicates defined in the assumptions.

### Notes
1. **Temporal Logic**: The conditions use logical expressions that could assess the state at a particular point or continuously, depending on the system's temporal requirements.
2. **Actions**: The guarantee part is left abstract because the specific actions (`[action <- functionName()]`) depend heavily on the API and the system's capabilities, which are not defined in this scenario.

This TSL template provides a structured logic framework assuming you have a base system where `total` and `e` are continuously monitored and can trigger changes based on their states. For actual implementation, the interaction with a physical or software-based system would require an API that allows for checking these conditions and executing the corresponding actions.
