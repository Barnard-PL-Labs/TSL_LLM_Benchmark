To implement the predicates as specified, we will write them in the context of Temporal Stream Logic (TSL) templates. Since the predicates are meant to return boolean values based on the conditions provided, the TSL expressions will reflect these conditions.

```tsl
always assume {
  // Definitions of predicates for the "total" cell
  (isLessThanPoint75(total) <-> (total < 0.75));
  (isLessThanOne(total) <-> (total < 1));
  (isLessThanOnePoint25(total) <-> (total < 1.25));

  // Definitions of predicates for the "e" cell representing key presses
  (pressD(e) <-> (e == 'd'));
  (pressQ(e) <-> (e == 'q'));
  (pressO(e) <-> (e == 'o'));
  (press1(e) <-> (e == '1'));
  (press2(e) <-> (e == '2'));
  (press3(e) <-> (e == '3'));
  (pressR(e) <-> (e == 'r'));
}
always guarantee {
  // The guarantee block is left empty as there are no specific actions or reactions to define in this context,
  // assuming no functions to implement as per the instruction.
}
```

In these TSL expressions:
- We use the `<->` (if and only if) logical operator to strictly define the conditions under which each predicate should return true.
- `e` and `total` are assumed to be cells (or variables) that carry the current state values for the vending machine's operations and user inputs, respectively.
- The `always assume` block is used to declare the conditions under which each predicate holds true, effectively modeling the behavior of these predicates.
- The `always guarantee` block does not contain any entries because the task specifies no reactions or system functionalities to guarantee based on the predicates.

This TSL setup provides a specific, logic-based framework that mirrors the boolean nature of predicates within a reactive system environment.
