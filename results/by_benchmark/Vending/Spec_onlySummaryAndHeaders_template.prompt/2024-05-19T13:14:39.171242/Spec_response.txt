Here's the TSL specification for the vending machine described in the natural language description. This specification considers the various button presses and their effects on the vending machine operations including product selection and money insertion, ensuring mutual exclusion of operations and the correct conditions for each action.

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure that no two machine operations can be performed at the same time
  !(press1(e) && press2(e));
  !(press1(e) && press3(e));
  !(press1(e) && pressD(e));
  !(press1(e) && pressQ(e));
  !(press1(e) && pressO(e));
  !(press1(e) && pressR(e));
  !(press2(e) && press3(e));
  !(press2(e) && pressD(e));
  !(press2(e) && pressQ(e));
  !(press2(e) && pressO(e));
  !(press2(e) && pressR(e));
  !(press3(e) && pressD(e));
  !(press3(e) && pressQ(e));
  !(press3(e) && pressO(e));
  !(press3(e) && pressR(e));
  !(pressD(e) && pressQ(e));
  !(pressD(e) && pressO(e));
  !(pressD(e) && pressR(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && pressO(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && pressR(e));
  !(pressO(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Purchase product option 1 when the total is 0.75 or more and button 1 is pressed
  press1(e) && isLessThanPoint75(total) == false -> [total <- total - 0.75];
  
  // Purchase product option 2 when the total is 1 or more and button 2 is pressed
  press2(e) && isLessThanOne(total) == false -> [total <- total - 1];
  
  // Purchase product option 3 when the total is 1.25 or more and button 3 is pressed
  press3(e) && isLessThanOnePoint25(total) == false -> [total <- total - 1.25];
  
  // Insert a dime by pressing the d key/button
  pressD(e) -> [total <- total + 0.10];
  
  // Insert a quarter by pressing the q key/button
  pressQ(e) -> [total <- total + 0.25];
  
  // Insert a dollar by pressing the o key/button
  pressO(e) -> [total <- total + 1.00];
  
  // Refund the money by pressing the r key/button
  pressR(e) -> [total <- 0];
}
```

This specification ensures that the vending machine reacts appropriately to button presses, updating the total amount accordingly and allowing products to be purchased if there is sufficient credit. It also upholds the requirement that no two operations can be concurrent.
