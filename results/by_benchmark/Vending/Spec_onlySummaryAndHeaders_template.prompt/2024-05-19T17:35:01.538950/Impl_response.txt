In TSL, to reflect the predicates for a vending machine based on the given scenario and API details, you would define the predicates in the "always assume" section. Here's how you can set up the TSL template for the vending machine:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Define the predicates based on conditions given in the problem statement

  // Predicates to check the total amount inserted into the vending machine
  isLessThanPoint75(total) ;
  isLessThanOne(total) ;
  isLessThanOnePoint25(total) ;

  // Predicates to check which key is pressed by the user
  pressD(e) ;
  pressQ(e) ;
  pressO(e) ;
  press1(e) ;
  press2(e) ;
  press3(e) ;
  pressR(e) ;
}
always guarantee {
  // Depending on the use case, define the system response here
  // For instance, if a key is pressed to select an item or add an amount,
  // update the system state accordingly. This section needs specific
  // requirements to provide accurate logic.
}
```

In this setup:
- `isLessThanPoint75(total)`, `isLessThanOne(total)`, and `isLessThanOnePoint25(total)` check various thresholds of the total amount inserted, which could correspond to different product prices or minimum required amounts for operation in the vending machine.
- `pressD(e)`, `pressQ(e)`, `pressO(e)`, `press1(e)`, `press2(e)`, `press3(e)`, and `pressR(e)` are predicates that would return `true` when specific keys are pressed. These could be used to select items or interact with the vending machine in other ways.

For real-world applications, you might also define the actions in the `always guarantee` section based on these predicates to control the behavior of the vending machine, such as dispensing products, returning change, displaying messages, etc. This part of the TSL would greatly depend on the exact functional requirements of the vending machine.
