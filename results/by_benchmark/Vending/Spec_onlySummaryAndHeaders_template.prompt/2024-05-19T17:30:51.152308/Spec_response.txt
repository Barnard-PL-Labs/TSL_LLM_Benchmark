Here's the TSL specification based on the description you provided for the vending machine operations. This specification ensures that the machine operations cannot overlap and are dependent on the total amount of money available:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Mutually exclusive button presses
  !(pressD(e) && pressQ(e));
  !(pressD(e) && pressO(e));
  !(pressD(e) && pressR(e));
  !(pressD(e) && press1(e));
  !(pressD(e) && press2(e));
  !(pressD(e) && press3(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && pressO(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && pressR(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && press1(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && press2(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && press3(e));
  !(pressO(e) && pressR(e));
  !(pressO(e) && press1(e));
  !(pressO(e) && press2(e));
  !(pressO(e) && press3(e));
  !(pressR(e) && press1(e));
  !(pressR(e) && press2(e));
  !(pressR(e) && press3(e));
  !(press1(e) && press2(e));
  !(press1(e) && press3(e));
  !(press2(e) && press3(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Inserting money operations
  pressD(e) -> [total <- total + 0.10];
  pressQ(e) -> [total <- total + 0.25];
  pressO(e) -> [total <- total + 1.00];
  pressR(e) -> [total <- 0];
  
  // Purchasing product options
  press1(e) && !isLessThanPoint75(total) -> [total <- total - 0.75];
  press2(e) && !isLessThanOne(total) -> [total <- total - 1.00];
  press3(e) && !isLessThanOnePoint25(total) -> [total <- total - 1.25];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assumptions for Exclusivity**: In the assumption section, it's stated that no two operations (button presses) can occur simultaneously. This ensures that the machine processes one command at a time, avoiding conflicting actions.

2. **Guarantees for Operations**:
   - **Money Insertion**: When buttons 'd', 'q', or 'o' are pressed, the total money in the machine is increased by the respective amounts (dime, quarter, or dollar).
   - **Product Purchase**: Checks are performed to ensure there is enough money before a product is dispensed. If so, the respective amount is subtracted from the total.
   - **Refunding**: Pressing 'r' resets the total to zero.

This TSL specification ensures that the vending machine operates logically in response to user inputs, respecting the constraints of mutual exclusivity and conditional operations based on the total amount of money inserted.
