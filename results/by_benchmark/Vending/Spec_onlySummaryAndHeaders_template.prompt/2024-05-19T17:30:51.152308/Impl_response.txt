In this setup, it seems you are looking to implement predicates (boolean-returning functions) for a vending machine system using JavaScript. Since there's no actual code for the API provided, I'll assume we're working with hypothetical function calls that interact with the system's state `total` and event `e` to determine user actions and the machine's state.

Below are the implementations for the predicates you listed:

```javascript
// Predicate implementations using JavaScript

// Checks if the total is less than 0.75
function isLessThanPoint75(total) {
    return total < 0.75;
}

// Checks if the total is less than 1
function isLessThanOne(total) {
    return total < 1;
}

// Checks if the total is less than 1.25
function isLessThanOnePoint25(total) {
    return total < 1.25;
}

// Checks if the 'd' key was pressed
function pressD(e) {
    return e.key === 'd';
}

// Checks if the 'q' key was pressed
function pressQ(e) {
    return e.key === 'q';
}

// Checks if the 'o' key was pressed
function pressO(e) {
    return e.key === 'o';
}

// Checks if the '1' key was pressed
function press1(e) {
    return e.key === '1';
}

// Checks if the '2' key was pressed
function press2(e) {
    return e.key === '2';
}

// Checks if the '3' key was pressed
function press3(e) {
    return e.key === '3';
}

// Checks if the 'r' key was pressed
function pressR(e) {
    return e.key === 'r';
}
```

### Usage:
These functions should be called with the appropriate inputs to evaluate the predicates. For example, in the context of an event listener, you might have:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
    if (pressQ(event)) {
        console.log("Q key was pressed.");
    }
});

// Assuming 'total' is a variable that holds the total amount in the vending machine
let total = 0.5;
if (isLessThanPoint75(total)) {
    console.log("Total is less than 0.75.");
}
```

This setup allows you to use these predicates to control the flow of your application based on the `total` state of the vending machine and user interactions through keypress events.
