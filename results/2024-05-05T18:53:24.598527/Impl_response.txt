To implement the given tasks, we will use the `addEventListener` method to handle keypresses for the up arrow key and manage predicates primarily using TSL specifications to interact within a system environment that involves a cube's scale adjustment. Below, I will provide the TSL predicates and assumptions to match your requirements, as JavaScript implementation is not necessary per your instruction.

### TSL Implementation:

We'll define predicates that monitor keyboard events and manage interactivity connected with a cube object in a simulated environment.

#### Assumptions Regarding Inputs
The assumption segment will handle inputs from the environment, which includes checking if the up arrow key was pressed.

#### Guarantee on System Interaction
The guarantee section will ensure the system reacts correctly when an event occurs (i.e., a keypress).

### Setting Up TSL Definitions:

**Predicates:**
1. `pressUp(e)`: This predicate will be true when the up arrow key is pressed.

To define these behaviors in a TSL environment where we do not code them explicitly in JavaScript but describe them in templated logic:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Define the behavior when the up arrow key is pressed.
  // "pressUp(e)" becomes true when the "up" arrow key is pressed.
  // System environment's API allows to identify keys; assuming API provides keycode or similar identification.
  pressUp(e) <-> key == 'UP_ARROW'; // "key" is hypothetically the pressed key identifier
}
```

In an actual implementation scenario, ensure you map `'UP_ARROW'` or similar identifiers based on what your system environment or API uses to detect key events. This pseudocode assumes a hypothetical property or method that distinguishes key presses.

#### Real World JavaScript Context
To align this with what it might look like in a practical JavaScript setting (for understanding, not for use per the instructions):

You would typically use:
```javascript
window.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
  if (event.key === "ArrowUp" || event.keyCode === 38) {
    // Here, you would set some condition or variable to true to indicate the up arrow is pressed
    // Example: isUpPressed = true; (In practical application, you could set cube.scale.x here directly or signal it through system's state management)
  }
});
```
In this sample, the event listener checks if the up arrow key is pressed (considering both `event.key` and the deprecated `event.keyCode` for compatibility). 

By setting up the system this way using TSL, you abstract the direct handling of DOM events and focus on logic specifications and interactions, thereby allowing a more direct connection with system-level programming practices usually found in scenarios involving hardware, lower-level software simulation, or complex system modeling where multiple components (like a cube's physical properties) are interactively managed over time.
