Below is the TSL specification that corresponds to the natural language description provided. It includes assumptions about mutual exclusivity of button presses and guarantees about how button presses affect the counter and stepsize:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Mutual exclusivity: No two buttons can be pressed at the same time
  !(pressA(e) && pressB(e));
  !(pressA(e) && pressC(e));
  !(pressB(e) && pressC(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Guarantee for pressA: Increment the count by the current stepsize
  pressA(e) -> [count <- count + stepsize];

  // Guarantee for pressB: Increment the count by 2 and reset stepsize to 1
  pressB(e) -> ([count <- count + 2] && [stepsize <- 1]);

  // Guarantee for pressC: Increment the count by 3 and reset stepsize to 1
  pressC(e) -> ([count <- count + 3] && [stepsize <- 1]);

  // Handle stepsize modification on sequential pressA presses
  // This pseudo code needs a way to detect "three times in a row"
  // For simplification, we could use a counter for pressA:
  // pressCountA, which should be reset on pressB or pressC
  pressA(e) -> (
    [pressCountA <- pressCountA + 1]
    );
  pressB(e) || pressC(e) -> [pressCountA <- 0];

  // If pressA was pressed three times in a row, then increase stepsize by three times on the fourth press
  (pressCountA == 3 && pressA(e)) -> [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)];
}
```

This specification manages button presses using logical constraints defined under assumptions and maintains the state of the counter and the stepsize under guarantees. It also uses a counter (pressCountA) to track three consecutive presses of the A button, altering the stepsize if this condition is met and A is pressed a fourth time. Note that resetting pressCountA is performed when either button B or C is pressed, as per the requirements.
