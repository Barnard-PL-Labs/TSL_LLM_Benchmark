To implement the given functions and predicates corresponding to the provided system environment API in JavaScript, we will define each function and predicate clearly. Functions such as `sin(x)` and `saw(x)` will involve mathematical implementations for sine and sawtooth wave calculations, respectively. For predicates such as `pressL(e)` and `pressR(e)`, we will use event listeners to determine if the left or right button is pressed.

Here’s the JavaScript code that fulfills the specifications:

### Functions:

```javascript
// Function to calculate sine of x
function sin(x) {
    return Math.sin(x);
}

// Function to calculate sawtooth wave of x
function saw(x) {
    // Normalize x to a range of 0 to 2π
    let period = 2 * Math.PI; 
    x = x % period; 
    if (x < 0) {
        x += period;
    }
    
    // Compute and return the sawtooth value
    return (2 * x / period) - 1;
}
```

### Predicates:

For the predicates, since you have indicated that the event listener should be inside the function, it suggests that these functions will setup their own event listening mechanism and perhaps store an internal state based on the button pushes. However, note that typically event listeners are not set up inside such getter-like functions directly due to concerns over adding multiple listeners. Here's one conceptual approach:

```javascript
// Setting up a simple state to monitor button presses
let buttonStates = {
    left: false,
    right: false
};

// Initialize event listeners on document
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(e) {
    if (e.key === 'ArrowLeft') {
        buttonStates.left = true;
    } else if (e.key === 'ArrowRight') {
        buttonStates.right = true;
    }
});

document.addEventListener('keyup', function(e) {
    if (e.key === 'ArrowLeft') {
        buttonStates.left = false;
    } else if (e.key === 'ArrowRight') {
        buttonStates.right = false;
    }
});

// Predicate to check if the left button is pressed
function pressL() {
    return buttonStates.left;
}

// Predicate to check if the right button is pressed
function pressR() {
    return buttonStates.right;
}
```

### System API Integration:

Here's how you might use these in an environment where you want to manipulate `cube.scale.x` using sine and sawtooth waves:

```javascript
function updateCubeScale() {
    if (pressL()) {
        cube.scale.x = sin(new Date().getTime() / 1000);
    } else if (pressR()) {
        cube.scale.x = saw(new Date().getTime() / 1000);
    }
}

// Assuming cube.scale.x could be set up here:
let cube = {
    scale: {
        x: 1
    }
};

// Regularly update the cube's scale
setInterval(updateCubeScale, 100);
```

This code integrates real-time reaction to key presses to adjust a property (like a cube's scale in a 3D rendering environment), using a sinusoidal and sawtooth pattern over time based on which key is pressed. Adjust the time division in `sin` and `saw` functions to control the wave frequency.
