Here is the corresponding TSL specification for the vending machine based on the provided details:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Mutual exclusion for button presses: no two operations can occur simultaneously
  !(pressD(e) && pressQ(e));
  !(pressD(e) && pressO(e));
  !(pressD(e) && press1(e));
  !(pressD(e) && press2(e));
  !(pressD(e) && press3(e));
  !(pressD(e) && pressR(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && pressO(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && press1(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && press2(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && press3(e));
  !(pressQ(e) && pressR(e));
  !(pressO(e) && press1(e));
  !(pressO(e) && press2(e));
  !(pressO(e) && press3(e));
  !(pressO(e) && pressR(e));
  !(press1(e) && press2(e));
  !(press1(e) && press3(e));
  !(press1(e) && pressR(e));
  !(press2(e) && press3(e));
  !(press2(e) && pressR(e));
  !(press3(e) && pressR(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Increase "total" by 0.1 when D is pressed
  pressD(e) -> [total <- total + 0.1];

  // Increase "total" by 0.25 when Q is pressed
  pressQ(e) -> [total <- total + 0.25];

  // Increase "total" by 1 when O is pressed
  pressO(e) -> [total <- total + 1];

  // Decrease "total" by 0.75 when 1 is pressed but only if "total" is 0.75 or greater
  press1(e) && isLessThanPoint75(total) -> [total <- total - 0.75];

  // Decrease "total" by 1 when 2 is pressed but only if "total" is 1 or greater
  press2(e) && isLessThanOne(total) -> [total <- total - 1];

  // Decrease "total" by 1.25 when 3 is pressed but only if "total" is 1.25 or greater
  press3(e) && isLessThanOnePoint25(total) -> [total <- total - 1.25];

  // Reset "total" to 0 when R is pressed
  pressR(e) -> [total <- 0];
}
```

This TSL specification enforces mutual exclusion between button operations, ensuring no two button operations happen simultaneously. It also adjusts the "total" in the system based on button operations, aligning with the respective conditions detailed in the natural language description. Each button operation that adjusts "total" will either increment or decrement the value based on the specific button that's pressed and conditional requirements.
