Here is the TSL specification based on the given description:

```tsl
always assume {
    // Define mutually exclusive button presses if applicable
    // Assuming buttonE, buttonG, and buttonA are inputs for playing E4, G4, and A4 respectively.
    !(buttonE && buttonG);
    !(buttonE && buttonA);
    !(buttonG && buttonA);
}

always guarantee {
    // Specify the behavior of playing notes based on button presses
    buttonE -> [noteToPlay <- "E4"];
    buttonG -> [noteToPlay <- "G4"];
    buttonA -> [noteToPlay <- "A4"];
    
    // Allow for simultaneous notes by assigning to another variable if two buttons are pressed
    (buttonE && buttonG) -> ([noteToPlay <- "E4"] && [noteToPlay2 <- "G4"]);
    (buttonE && buttonA) -> ([noteToPlay <- "E4"] && [noteToPlay2 <- "A4"]);
    (buttonG && buttonA) -> ([noteToPlay <- "G4"] && [noteToPlay2 <- "A4"]);
}
```

This specification assumes basic inputs for button presses and assigns the musical notes to either `noteToPlay` or `noteToPlay2` variables to allow two notes to be played simultaneously, adhering to the provided scenario constraints.
