To translate the provided scenario into a TSL specification, we need to integrate the constraints and effects of pressing each of the buttons A, B, and C, along with the rules for how they interact. Here's the TSL representation:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Ensure mutual exclusion between button presses
  !(pressA(e) && pressB(e));
  !(pressA(e) && pressC(e));
  !(pressB(e) && pressC(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Handling the press of button A
  pressA(e) -> (
    // If A is pressed three times consecutively without B or C being pressed, multiply stepsize by 3
    (X (pressA(e) && X (pressA(e) && !pressB(e) && !pressC(e)))) -> [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)]
  );

  // If button B or C is pressed, reset stepsize to 1
  (pressB(e) || pressC(e)) -> [stepsize <- 1];

  // Ensure that the stepsize value persists unless altered by the conditions above
  !(pressA(e) && X (pressA(e) && X (pressA(e) && !pressB(e) && !pressC(e)))) && !(pressB(e) || pressC(e)) -> [stepsize <- stepsize];
}

```

### Explanation:

1. **Assumptions**: Mutual exclusivity is ensured so that no two button presses can occur at the same time.
2. **Guarantees**:
   - **For Button A**: If pressed three times consecutively without intervening presses of B or C, it modifies `stepsize` by multiplying it by three. This is checked by looking at the state following two further presses of A with no presses of B or C in between.
   - **For Buttons B and C**: Pressing either button resets `stepsize` to 1.
   - **Persistence of State**: If none of the above conditions are met, `stepsize` retains its value. 

This TSL code captures the complex interaction and state dependency described in the scenario, implementing the business logic through temporal conditions and actions tied to specific sequences of button presses.
