Here is the TSL specification for the given natural language description related to the ball bouncing between two walls:

```TSL
always assume {
  ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)] -> X !rightmost(ball)) ;
  ([ball <- moveRight(ball)] -> X !leftmost(ball)) ;
  !(leftmost(ball) && rightmost(ball)) ;
}

always guarantee {
  rightmost(ball) -> F ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)]) ;
  leftmost(ball) -> F ([ball <- moveRight(ball)]) ;
  !(leftmost(ball) || rightmost(ball)) -> F ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)] || [ball <- moveRight(ball)]) ;
  
  (leftmost(ball) && X ([ball <- moveRight(ball)])) -> (!([ball <- moveLeft(ball)]) W rightmost(ball)) ;
  (rightmost(ball) && X ([ball <- moveLeft(ball)])) -> (!([ball <- moveRight(ball)]) W leftmost(ball)) ;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Assumptions**:
    - After moving the ball to the left, in the next state, it cannot be at the rightmost wall.
    - After moving the ball to the right, in the next state, it cannot be at the leftmost wall.
    - The ball cannot be at both the leftmost and rightmost walls at the same time.

2. **Guarantees**:
    - If the ball is at the rightmost wall, it must eventually move left.
    - If the ball is at the leftmost wall, it must eventually move right.
    - If the ball is neither at the leftmost nor rightmost wall, it must eventually move either left or right.
    - If the ball is at the leftmost wall and is set to move right in the next state, it must continue not moving left until it reaches the rightmost wall.
    - If the ball is at the rightmost wall and is set to move left in the next state, it must continue not moving right until it reaches the leftmost wall.
