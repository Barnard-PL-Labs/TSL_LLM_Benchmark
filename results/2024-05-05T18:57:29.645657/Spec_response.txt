To translate the rules of the Game of Life into a TSL specification for a single cell state machine, we need to consider the main rules regarding how a cell can either become alive or dead, based on the number of its living neighbors:

1. A cell becomes alive only if it has exactly 3 living neighbors.
2. A living cell remains alive if it has 2 or 3 living neighbors.
3. A cell dies if it has fewer than 2 or more than 3 living neighbors.

Based on these rules, we can define the TSL specification using the given functions and predicates:

```TSL
always assume {
  // Ensure that the predicates for coming alive or dead are mutually exclusive for readability and logic separation.
  !(comeAlive(index) && comeDead(index));
}

always guarantee {
  // If exactly 3 neighbours are living, the cell should become alive
  comeAlive(index) -> [alive <- true];
  
  // If the cell is alive and has 2 or 3 living neighbours, it should stay alive
  (alive && comeAlive(index)) -> [alive <- true];

  // If the cell has fewer than 2 or more than 3 living neighbours, it should become dead
  comeDead(index) -> [alive <- false];
  
  // If none of the conditions to change state are met, the cell should stay in its current state
  !(comeAlive(index) || comeDead(index)) -> [alive <- alive];
}
```

This specification defines the behavior:
- Cells become alive or stay alive under specific neighbor conditions (comeAlive for exactly 3 neighbors, or alive and comeAlive for 2 or 3 neighbors if already alive).
- Cells become dead if they have too few (fewer than 2) or too many (more than 3) neighbors (comeDead).
- If none of the conditions for changing state are met, cells retain their current state, ensuring stability where rules don't prescribe a change.
