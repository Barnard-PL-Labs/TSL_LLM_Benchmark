We need to create functions and predicates using JavaScript that interact with a cube in a 3D environment where the cube's scale along the x-axis can be manipulated. The functions include mathematical operations such as the sine and sawtooth wave functions, and the predicates involve detecting button presses. Below, I'll provide a JavaScript implementation for each component as described:

### 1. Functions: Sin and Saw

#### Sine Function
This function simply utilizes JavaScript's Math.sin() to compute the sine of an angle (which should be in radians).

```javascript
function sin(x) {
  return Math.sin(x);
}
```

#### Sawtooth Function
The sawtooth wave function can be implemented using a basic formula. This function assumes the input `x` is within a typical waveform period (like 0 to 2Ï€ for consistency with trigonometric functions), but it can be scaled accordingly based on the use case.

```javascript
function saw(x) {
  return 2 * (x / (2 * Math.PI) - Math.floor(0.5 + x / (2 * Math.PI)));
}
```

### 2. Predicates: pressL and pressR

For the predicates, we assume "e" is an event object passed from event listeners attached to some interactive elements on the web page. These functions need to be tied to actual event listeners that check for specific keys (assuming keyboard input for "left" and "right").

#### HTML Setup
Firstly, we need an HTML structure to capture the key events.
```html
<div tabindex="0" id="event-catcher" style="width: 100%; height: 100%; outline: none;">
  Click here to interact
</div>
```

#### JavaScript Setup
Now, we setup the JavaScript to listen to key events on this div and implement the predicates.
```javascript
let leftPressed = false;
let rightPressed = false;

document.getElementById('event-catcher').addEventListener('keydown', function(e) {
  if (e.key === "ArrowLeft") {
    leftPressed = true;
  }
  if (e.key === "ArrowRight") {
    rightPressed = true;
  }
});

document.getElementById('event-catcher').addEventListener('keyup', function(e) {
  if (e.key === "ArrowLeft") {
    leftPressed = false;
  }
  if (e.key === "ArrowRight") {
    rightPressed = false;
  }
});

function pressL() {
  return leftPressed;
}

function pressR() {
  return rightPressed;
}
```

#### Explanation
- `leftPressed` and `rightPressed` are flags storing the current state (pressed or not) of the left and right keys.
- We add listeners for `keydown` and `keyup` to update these flags.
- The functions `pressL` and `pressR` simply return the current values of these flags, effectively telling us if the left or right key is currently pressed.

This setup should efficiently handle the system requirement to determine when the left or right keys are pressed, using the encapsulated event-driven model.
