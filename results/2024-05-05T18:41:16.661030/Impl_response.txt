To implement the described functionality in JavaScript, we'll build out these functions and predicates based on the API requirements that indicate interaction with a "ball" cell. Here's how you can structure these methods:

### JavaScript Implementation
```javascript
// Functions for moving the ball left and right
function moveLeft(ball) {
    // This function simulates sending a signal to move the ball to the left
    // This can involve modifying a property of the ball, invoking an API method, etc.
    // Depending on the actual environment configuration. Here's a placeholder:
    ball.direction = 'left';
}

function moveRight(ball) {
    // Similar to moveLeft, but sends a signal to move the ball to the right
    ball.direction = 'right';
}

// Predicates to check if the ball is at the leftmost or rightmost walls
function leftmost(ball) {
    // This predicate checks if the ball is at the leftmost position
    // The condition depends on the limits defined by the system; example:
    return ball.position === 0;
}

function rightmost(ball) {
    // This predicate checks if the ball is at the rightmost position
    // The condition depends on the limits defined by the system; example:
    return ball.position === ball.maxPosition; // assuming maxPosition is the rightmost limit
}

// Example Cell (this would typically be provided by the system environment)
let ball = {
    position: 5,  // Current position of the ball
    maxPosition: 10,  // Maximum allowed position (rightmost wall)
    direction: 'none'  // Current direction of movement ('left', 'right', 'none')
};

// Example usage
moveLeft(ball);
console.log(ball.direction); // Output: 'left'

if (leftmost(ball)) {
    console.log("Ball is at the leftmost position.");
}

moveRight(ball);
if (rightmost(ball)) {
    console.log("Ball is at the rightmost position.");
}
```

### Considerations
1. **Position Management**: The implementation assumes a simplistic model where a "position" numerically defines where the ball is along some one-dimensional scale. You'll need a mechanism to initialize and update these values according to actual system interactions.

2. **Boundary Definitions**: The `leftmost` and `rightmost` functions assume that there are explicit boundaries (`position == 0` for leftmost and `position == maxPosition` for rightmost). You need to define how these bounds are determined in your actual environment.

3. **Integration**: The functions and predicates need to work within the layout of the system's API. That is, they need to tie in with how the system reads/writes 'ball' state, handles 'directions', and detects 'positions'. Depending on your system, this might involve more sophisticated state management or API calls. 

4. **Testing**: Make sure to adequately test these functions especially at the boundary conditions (like immediately after moving to the boundaries).

By building on this basic framework, you can tailor the functions to handle the specifics of your environment, like adding event listeners or integrating with other system components. Make sure the actual movement controls (if any), like rendering or updates, are handled as per the system's capabilities and restrictions.
