Here's how you can translate the provided natural language description into a TSL (Temporal Stream Logic) specification. This specification will assume certain conditions about the key events and guarantee how the cube's scale along the x-axis reacts based on the user's input.

```tsl
always assume {
  // Handling mutual exclusivity on key press events, ensuring no other conflicting events
  // occur simultaneously that aren't mentioned (for simplicity, not including other keys here).
}

always guarantee {
  // When the up key is not pressed, cube's scale.x should be 0.5
  !pressUp(e) -> [cube.scale.x <- 0.5];

  // When the up key is pressed, increment cube's scale.x each frame until the key is released
  pressUp(e) -> ([cube.scale.x <- cube.scale.x + 0.1] W !pressUp(e));
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Assumptions (always assume block):** Here, mutual exclusivity of events is generally considered to rule out simultaneous contradictory conditions. This example hasn't defined other conflicting inputs explicitly due to the focus being on the up key only.

2. **Guarantees (always guarantee block):**
   - **Cube Scale on No Input:** When the up key (`pressUp(e)`) is not pressed, the scale along the x-axis (`cube.scale.x`) is maintained at 0.5. This is denoted by the immediate assignment `[cube.scale.x <- 0.5]` whenever `!pressUp(e)` is true.
   - **Cube Scale on Input:** When the up key is pressed, the scale along the x-axis is incrementally increased by 0.1 units each frame. This continues until the up key is released. The expression `[cube.scale.x <- cube.scale.x + 0.1] W !pressUp(e)` expresses that the cube's scale will keep increasing each frame by 0.1 as long as the up key remains pressed, and will stop increasing when the key is no longer pressed.

This TSL code effectively handles the dynamic reaction of the cube's scale to ongoing user input, in particular, the pressing and releasing of the up arrow key.
