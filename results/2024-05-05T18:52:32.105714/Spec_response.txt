Here's how the TSL specification could look like based on the natural language description provided:

```
always assume {
  // A, B, and C keys cannot be pressed at the same time
  ! (pressA(e) && pressB(e));
  ! (pressA(e) && pressC(e));
  ! (pressB(e) && pressC(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // Incrementing counter based on which button is pressed
  pressA(e) -> [count <- count + stepsize];
  pressB(e) -> [count <- count + 2];
  pressC(e) -> [count <- count + 3];

  // Handling stepsize modifications when A is pressed three times consecutively
  (pressA(e) && X(pressA(e)) && X(X(pressA(e))) && X(X(X(pressA(e))))) -> [stepsize <- multiplyByThree(stepsize)];

  // Resetting the stepsize on pressing B or C
  (pressB(e) || pressC(e)) -> [stepsize <- 1];

  // Ensure stepsize is initialized to 1 at the start
  [initial(stepsize) <- 1];
}
```

In this TSL setup:

1. **Assumptions** ensure that no two button operations (`pressA`, `pressB`, `pressC`) can be performed simultaneously.
2. **Guarantees** manage the logic of how the counter for each button press is incremented and how the stepsize is managed based on the sequence and type of button presses. 
3. The `initial` function in TSL is used to set the initial value of `stepsize` to 1. 
4. The `multiplyByThree` function (or equivalent logic) will need to be defined elsewhere in the system or assumed as a known function that multiplies its argument by three.
