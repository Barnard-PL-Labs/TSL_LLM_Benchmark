To implement the predicates provided in the description using JavaScript, we can easily write functions that check each condition. Since these predicates belong to JavaScript, let's define them as JavaScript functions. Each function will take the necessary input, such as "total" for the monetary comparisons, or "e" for the key press checks, and return a boolean indicating whether the condition is met.

Here is an example implementation of each predicate as JavaScript functions:

```javascript
// Predicates to check the total against various thresholds
function isLessThanPoint75(total) {
  return total < 0.75;
}

function isLessThanOne(total) {
  return total < 1.00;
}

function isLessThanOnePoint25(total) {
  return total < 1.25;
}

// Predicates to check if specific keys were pressed
function pressD(e) {
  return e.key === 'd' || e.key === 'D';
}

function pressQ(e) {
  return e.key === 'q' || e.key === 'Q';
}

function pressO(e) {
  return e.key === 'o' || e.key === 'O';
}

function press1(e) {
  return e.key === '1';
}

function press2(e) {
  return e.key === '2';
}

function press3(e) {
  return e.key === '3';
}

function pressR(e) {
  return e.key === 'r' || e.key === 'R';
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Monetary Predicates**: `isLessThanPoint75`, `isLessThanOne`, and `isLessThanOnePoint25` take a numerical input (`total`) and compare it to specific values (0.75, 1, and 1.25, respectively), returning `true` if the `total` is less than the specified value, and `false` otherwise.

- **Key Press Predicates**: Each of the `press` functions takes an event parameter `e` (typically from a keyboard event), and checks if the desired key was pressed. This is done by comparing `e.key` to the expected character, ensuring that it works correctly regardless of whether the input is uppercase or lowercase (where applicable).

This setup functions correctly assuming that `'e'` represents an event object commonly obtained from event listeners in JavaScript, especially in scenarios involving handling keyboard inputs.
