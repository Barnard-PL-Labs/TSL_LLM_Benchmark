Based on the provided natural language description and the example TSL format you shared, here is the TSL specification for the behavior of a player's ship in the game Space Invaders:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Prevent simultaneous key presses for different directions
  !(pressL && pressR);
  !(pressL && pressUp);
  !(pressL && pressDown);
  !(pressR && pressUp);
  !(pressR && pressDown);
  !(pressUp && pressDown);
}

always guarantee {
  // If the ship is hit, the game registers a hit and may end the game or lose a life
  hit(ship) -> [die(ship)];

  // Handling left movement
  pressL && !leftmost(ship) -> [moveLeft(ship)];
  
  // Handling right movement
  pressR && !rightmost(ship) -> [moveRight(ship)];
  
  // Handling shooting action
  pressS -> [shoot(ship)];
}
```

### Explanation:

#### Assumptions:
1. **Mutual Exclusion for Key Inputs:** This ensures that no two directional keys can be pressed simultaneously, preventing conflicting movements and simplifying control logic.
  
#### Guarantees:
1. **Ship Hit Detection:** If the ship is hit (`hit(ship)`), the game will trigger the `die(ship)` function, which could mean ending the game or losing a life.
2. **Left Movement:** The ship moves left (`moveLeft(ship)`) if the left key (`pressL`) is pressed and the ship is not against the leftmost boundary (`!leftmost(ship)`).
3. **Right Movement:** Similarly, the ship moves right (`moveRight(ship)`) if the right key (`pressR`) is pressed and the ship is not against the rightmost boundary (`!rightmost(ship)`).
4. **Shooting Action:** When the shoot key (`pressS`) is pressed, the ship performs a shooting action (`shoot(ship)`), which could contribute to game mechanics such as attacking enemies. 

This setup ensures that the ship reacts appropriately to player inputs and game events, adhering to the rules of the game Space Invaders.
