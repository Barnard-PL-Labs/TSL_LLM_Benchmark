Here is the TSL translation based on the given natural language description involving the ball and walls:

```tsl
always assume {
  ([ ball <- moveLeft(ball) ] -> X !(rightmost(ball))) ;
  ([ ball <- moveRight(ball) ] -> X !(leftmost(ball))) ;
  !(leftmost(ball) && rightmost(ball)) ;
}

always guarantee {
  rightmost(ball)
    -> F ([ ball <- moveLeft(ball) ]) ;
  leftmost(ball)
    -> F ([ ball <- moveRight(ball) ]) ;
  !(leftmost(ball) || rightmost(ball))
    -> F ([ ball <- moveLeft(ball) ] || [ ball <- moveRight(ball) ]) ;
  (leftmost(ball) && X ([ ball <- moveRight(ball) ]))
    -> ([ ball <- moveRight(ball) ] W rightmost(ball)) ;
  (rightmost(ball) && X ([ ball <- moveLeft(ball) ]))
    -> ([ ball <- moveLeft(ball) ] W leftmost(ball)) ;
}
```

### Breakdown:

**Assumptions:**
1. When the ball is moved left, it will not be at the rightmost wall in the next state.
2. When the ball is moved right, it will not be at the leftmost wall in the next state.
3. The ball cannot be simultaneously at the leftmost and rightmost walls.

**Guarantees:**
4. If the ball is at the rightmost position, it should eventually receive a signal to move left.
5. If the ball is at the leftmost position, it should eventually receive a signal to move right.
6. If the ball is neither at the leftmost nor the rightmost position, it should eventually move in either direction.
7. If the ball is to move away from the leftmost wall, it shouldn’t move left until it reaches the rightmost wall.
8. If the ball is to move away from the rightmost wall, it shouldn’t move right until it reaches the leftmost wall.
