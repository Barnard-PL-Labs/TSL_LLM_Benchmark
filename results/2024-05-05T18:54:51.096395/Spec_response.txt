Here's the TSL specification for the described scenario with predicates and functions managing the rotation of a cube based on button inputs:

```tsl
always assume {
  // Define the exclusive relationship between pressing the right button and the left button
  !(pressR(e) && pressL(e));
}

always guarantee {
  // When the right button is pressed, rotate the cube to the right until the left button is pressed
  pressR(e) -> [cube <- rotateRight(cube)] W pressL(e);

  // When the left button is pressed, rotate the cube to the left until the right button is pressed
  pressL(e) -> [cube <- rotateLeft(cube)] W pressR(e);
}
```

This specification adheres to the requirements that the left and right buttons do not get pressed simultaneously and manages the direction of rotation based on which button is pressed, maintaining that direction until the other button is pressed.
