Here is the corresponding TSL specification for the given description, incorporating the assumptions and guarantees as mentioned:

```tsl
always assume{
  // No specific assumptions are described for environment, but we assume the key press detection is correctly functioning and singular
}

always guarantee{
  // Counter resets to 0.5 when the up key is not pressed
  !pressUp(e) -> [count <- 0.5];

  // Counter increments by 1 every frame when the up key is pressed
  pressUp(e) -> [count <- count + 1];

  // cube.scale.x updates with the value of count
  [cube.scale.x <- count];
}
```

In this specification:
- When the up key (`pressUp(e)`) is not pressed, the `count` is constantly set to `0.5`.
- When the up key is pressed, `count` increments by 1 in each subsequent frame, simulating the reactive and continuous response to the key being held down.
- The scale of the cube along the x-axis, `cube.scale.x`, is set to the `count`, so it directly reflects the value of `count`.
  
This TSL captures the behavior of the cube being scaled reactively to the up key being pressed and resetting when it's not pressed.
