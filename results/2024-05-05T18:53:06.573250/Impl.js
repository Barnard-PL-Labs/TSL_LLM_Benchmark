// Now, to use this in a TSL context, we'd consider 'isUpKeyPressed' as the input that gets checked.
// However, the TSL template setup would look something like this:

// Pseudocode for TSL setup:
always assume {
    // Nothing specific here unless other inputs are to be declared that might affect the predicate.
}

always guarantee {
    // This is where you'd use the 'isUpKeyPressed' state variable to decide actions based on its truth value.
    // Example (not executable here):
    // isUpKeyPressed -> [actionOnPressUp()]; // Perform some action when the up key is pressed.
}
