To implement the described functionality for manipulating and checking the position of a "ball" within a given API framework, we will define the functions and predicates in JavaScript. We'll simulate the behavior as described, assuming some abstract mechanics for how "ball" interacts with its environment without detailed specifications of the entire system. Here's how these methods might be written:

```javascript
// Assuming some environmental state or API for interacting with the "ball" that's not explicitly defined
// For the sake of this implementation, we'll define some applicable properties and simulate behavior.

// Sample environmental object that represents the ball's position (assuming max positions for illustrative purposes).
const environment = {
  ball: {
    position: 10,  // arbitrary middle value
    maxPosition: 20,  // assumes the rightmost wall is at position 20
    minPosition: 0  // assumes the leftmost wall is at position 0
  }
};

/**
 * Function to move the ball to the left.
 * Decrements the position of the ball by 1 unless it's at the leftmost boundary.
 * @param {Object} ball - A cell representing the ball.
 * @returns {string} - Signal to move the ball to the left.
 */
function moveLeft(ball) {
  if (ball.position > ball.minPosition) {
    ball.position -= 1;
  }
  return "Moved Left";
}

/**
 * Function to move the ball to the right.
 * Increments the position of the ball by 1 unless it's at the rightmost boundary.
 * @param {Object} ball - A cell representing the ball.
 * @returns {string} - Signal to move the ball to the right.
 */
function moveRight(ball) {
  if (ball.position < ball.maxPosition) {
    ball.position += 1;
  }
  return "Moved Right";
}

/**
 * Predicate to determine if the ball is against the leftmost wall.
 * @param {Object} ball - A cell representing the ball.
 * @returns {boolean} - True if ball is at the leftmost position, otherwise false.
 */
function leftmost(ball) {
  return ball.position === ball.minPosition;
}

/**
 * Predicate to determine if the ball is against the rightmost wall.
 * @param {Object} ball - A cell representing the ball.
 * @returns {boolean} - True if ball is at the rightmost position, otherwise false.
 */
function rightmost(ball) {
  return ball.position === ball.maxPosition;
}

// Test the functionality:
console.log(`Initial Position: ${environment.ball.position}`);
console.log(moveLeft(environment.ball));
console.log(`Position after moving left: ${environment.ball.position}`);
console.log(leftmost(environment.ball));  // Check if ball is at the leftmost
console.log(moveRight(environment.ball));
console.log(`Position after moving right: ${environment.ball.position}`);
console.log(rightmost(environment.ball));  // Check if ball is at the rightmost

// Continue adding actions and tests as needed to fully simulate behavior in this mocked environment.
```

This simple setup leverages an object (`environment`) to simulate a scenario in which a "ball" can move within specified bounds, and defined functions allow movement while predicates check conditions relating to those bounds. This mock setup, while simplistic and highly abstracted, illustrates the requested JavaScript implementation framework for your described APIs.
